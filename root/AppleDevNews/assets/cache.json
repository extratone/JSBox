And you can publish up to 35 custom product pages per app, giving you the flexibility and freedom to market your app to multiple audiences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTech Talks \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet started with custom product pages\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCustom Product Pages OverviewBoost your content with custom assets and linksHelp people download your app with the App Store Marketing Tools. Use the site to generate a content link, short link, or QR code that takes people directly to your product page on the App Store. You can also generate “Download on the App Store” badges — including localized versions of these assets — and embed them in your marketing communications to promote downloads of your app. You can even customize your marketing with banners and images and add preset messages in multiple languages to promote your apps in your advertising efforts.\nTo get started, simply find your app, then copy and embed the URL and add it on your website or other promotional efforts. Be sure to review the App Store Marketing and Identity Guidelines for information on proper badge use and graphic standards.App Store Marketing ToolsCreate Smart App Banners to promote your app from a websiteMake it easy for people to download or open your app from your website on iOS and iPadOS. With Safari’s Smart App Banners, you can display an unobtrusive banner that provides a direct link to your app on the App Store or directly opens the app if it’s already installed.Promoting Apps with Smart App BannersGenerate promo codes to raise awareness of your appGive people, press, and influencers early access to your app or its in-app purchases with promo codes. These codes are configured in App Store Connect and can be created, distributed, and redeemed even before your app is live on the App Store. You can give away up to 100 promo codes per version of your app, per platform — and up to 100 promo codes per in-app purchase.Manage promo codesSubmit your app for feature consideration on the App StoreThe App Store editorial team helps shine a spotlight on App Store developers doing incredible work as well as the apps that impact the lives of people around the world. If your app, game, or development team has a unique story, the App Store’s editors would love to hear about it.\nFor best results, submit your story to the App Store editorial team at least six to eight weeks in advance of your launch or update.

Anyone with a bit of design sense can create a watch face in literally 30 seconds. The bulk of faces today are coming from indie designers. But fairly early on we partnered with brands like Star Trek, Tetris, and Garfield.</p>\n<p><strong>What has this meant for the watch-design community?</strong></p>\n<p>The traditional watch world has always been very closed. There’s a group, mostly coming out of Switzerland and a few other parts of the world, that have historically had the privilege to design watches. A lot of people have dreamed of designing watches themselves but couldn’t. The smartwatch and watch-face worlds have opened up that opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you handle customer feedback for a community of <em>Facer</em>’s size?</strong></p>\n<p>We don’t have a separate customer support team. I’m part of the customer support team! But we do have around a hundred designers in the watch-face community we chat with every day. If something’s broken, someone will hear about it.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your approach to creating new features?</strong></p>\n<p>We try to resist the inclination to start building because something feels cool. What feels cool to an engineer is not necessarily what feels cool to regular users, and those are the people you’re building apps for. For any new product or feature, we sit down, write out what it is, and come up with proof for why it’s going to succeed.</p>\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for developers who are just starting out?</strong></p>\n<p>If a product makes sense to you, you’ve probably already got competitors. Smart people tend to have the same ideas; if you’re really the first, there’s a good chance you don’t have the right one. So think hard about what makes you truly different. It’s easy to say, “Oh, my product is going to be better,” but you need to find that specific differentiating point. If you’re not confident about it, think some more or find another idea.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watch-faces-by-facer/id1057071179\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Download Watch Faces by Facer from the App Store</a></p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about the App Store Small Business Program</a></p>","contentSnippet":"Ariel Vardi’s road to launching Facer started a long way away.

There’s a group, mostly coming out of Switzerland and a few other parts of the world, that have historically had the privilege to design watches. A lot of people have dreamed of designing watches themselves but couldn’t. The smartwatch and watch-face worlds have opened up that opportunity.\nHow do you handle customer feedback for a community of Facer’s size?\nWe don’t have a separate customer support team. I’m part of the customer support team! But we do have around a hundred designers in the watch-face community we chat with every day. If something’s broken, someone will hear about it.\nWhat’s your approach to creating new features?\nWe try to resist the inclination to start building because something feels cool. What feels cool to an engineer is not necessarily what feels cool to regular users, and those are the people you’re building apps for. For any new product or feature, we sit down, write out what it is, and come up with proof for why it’s going to succeed.\nWhat advice do you have for developers who are just starting out?\nIf a product makes sense to you, you’ve probably already got competitors. Smart people tend to have the same ideas; if you’re really the first, there’s a good chance you don’t have the right one. So think hard about what makes you truly different. It’s easy to say, “Oh, my product is going to be better,” but you need to find that specific differentiating point. If you’re not confident about it, think some more or find another idea.Download Watch Faces by Facer from the App StoreLearn more about the App Store Small Business Program","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=q6mej749","isoDate":"2021-11-30T14:00:06.000Z"},{"title":"Tech Talks: final set of sessions and office hours now available","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mvo27858","pubDate":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 08:30:43 PST","content":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A12D1856-B218-44F8-BDCF-E6AFE8779301/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"\"></div><p>Connect with Apple experts to learn how to create best-in-class apps through office hours and live sessions with Q&amp;As until December 17.

For the first six months, it was just me designing, prototyping, and building. We had seven users, and each week I would launch new features and send out an email.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you persuade people to trust <em>Copilot</em> with their financial information?</strong> \nI’m wary of sharing my personal data, and that was one thing that bugged me with other apps: They’re free, but since the company has to make money, they’re selling your data. In the early days users told us, “Please don’t sell my data or put in ads. I’m willing to pay a few bucks for this service.” That was when we decided to charge a subscription, even though nobody really charges in this category. We can cover the cost of growing the business and building new features.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s been your biggest challenge?</strong>\nIn the early days, it was fundraising. I thought I was going to be able to fundraise with just an idea, honestly, but I got a lot of pushback: “People have done this. You’re wasting your time. Do you have any other ideas?” That’s why we started fully bootstrapped. But once we had a product — and with the type of love we get from users — the dynamic changed.</p>\n<p><strong>From a technical standpoint, what else is key to the <em>Copilot</em> experience?</strong>\nWe want you to open <em>Copilot</em> and feel like it’s a first-class app. I believe that having a native Swift app makes a difference the moment you start interacting with it. We invest a lot of engineering resources in crafting an experience you want to come back to.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s it been like to go from software engineer to CEO?</strong>\nI still code. Not as much as I used to, but I believe that to be an effective leader, I need to stay close to that. Engineers and designers are often told they should focus on the technical aspects or the design and leave the rest to businesspeople. I believe that’s fundamentally wrong. We have a little bit of a superpower when it comes to understanding what goes into crafting a product that people want to use. At the end of the day, users can tell if you’re doing something with passion and love.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-the-smart-money-app/id1447330651\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Download Copilot: The Smart Money App from the App Store</a></p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about the App Store Small Business Program</a></p>","contentSnippet":"Andrés Ugarte is the type of person who’s always on the lookout for the perfect app to help him navigate life, but he never found one for managing his money. “I lost count of how many I tried,” he says.\nSo in 2018 he quit his job as a software engineer and started working on Copilot.

I thought I was going to be able to fundraise with just an idea, honestly, but I got a lot of pushback: “People have done this. You’re wasting your time. Do you have any other ideas?” That’s why we started fully bootstrapped. But once we had a product — and with the type of love we get from users — the dynamic changed.\nFrom a technical standpoint, what else is key to the Copilot experience?\nWe want you to open Copilot and feel like it’s a first-class app. I believe that having a native Swift app makes a difference the moment you start interacting with it. We invest a lot of engineering resources in crafting an experience you want to come back to.\nWhat’s it been like to go from software engineer to CEO?\nI still code. Not as much as I used to, but I believe that to be an effective leader, I need to stay close to that. Engineers and designers are often told they should focus on the technical aspects or the design and leave the rest to businesspeople. I believe that’s fundamentally wrong. We have a little bit of a superpower when it comes to understanding what goes into crafting a product that people want to use. At the end of the day, users can tell if you’re doing something with passion and love.Download Copilot: The Smart Money App from the App StoreLearn more about the App Store Small Business Program","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=m1mmw99d","isoDate":"2021-11-02T13:00:15.000Z"},{"title":"New Tech Talks sessions and office hours now available","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ptuzjp7s","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Nov 2021 10:00:03 PDT","content":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A12D1856-B218-44F8-BDCF-E6AFE8779301/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"\"></div><p>Tech Talks 2021 features live online sessions and office hours through December 17, so you can connect with Apple experts to learn how to create best-in-class apps.

Otherwise, read on!</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=keebiiyl\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Challenge: Memgraph Capture the Flag</a></p><p>The challenge begins with the following: “One of our engineers has hidden a memory easter egg in our secret app. We're trying to track it down but all we know is that it has format <code>flag_&lt;unknown_string_here&gt;@WWDC</code>. You’ll have to use the command line tools offered by macOS to investigate the memory issue, recover missing symbols, and and capture the rogue flag.”</p><p>The following solution is one of the possible paths to capture the flag. To start, the challenge article supplies you with a memgraph file and a dSYM, along with the following hint: “Memgraph is a special binary plist. What can you find in its properties?”</p>\n<p>To look at the properties of a Memgraph, use <code>plutil</code>. In the output, you’ll find more hints:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code>$ plutil -p secret.memgraph\n...\n&quot;hint&quot; =&gt; &quot;the flag is hiding in a memory leak&quot;\n...\n&quot;one_more_hint&quot; =&gt; &quot;you might also want to explore the &#x27;symbols&#x27; in the dSYM”\n...</code></pre><p>The hint invites you to investigate the memory leak, while <code>one_more_hint</code> directly encourages you to use the <code>symbols</code> CLI tool. In the WWDC21 session “Symbolication: Beyond the basics,” engineer Alejandro Lucena mentions that it’s a good idea to specify the architecture with this tool. As such, you can use the memgraph to learn the “secret” app’s architecture.</p>\n<p>You can try <code>heap</code>, <code>leaks</code> or <code>vmmap</code>. When used with a memgraph, the first few lines are the same in the output of each of these tools. This is how you learn which architecture the “secret\" process uses: <code>Code Type: X86-64</code>.</p>\n<p>As detailed in the WWDC21 session “Detect and diagnose memory problems,” you can use the vmmap command against memgraph files in addition to targeting the running process. Running it agaisnt this memgraph provides the following information: </p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code>$ vmmap -summary secret.memgraph \nProcess:         secret [2901]\nPath:            /Users/*/secret\nLoad Address:    0x10d264000\nIdentifier:      secret\nVersion:         0\nCode Type:       X86-64\nPlatform:        macOS\nParent Process:  zsh [1438]\n...</code></pre><p>Now you’re ready to use the <code>symbols</code> command. Use the <code>-noSources</code> option to restrict the output to symbol names so you have less output to look through. Hidden amidst the symbols in the “secret” dSYM, you’ll find another breadcrumb towards the solution:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code>$ symbols -arch x86_64 -noSources secret.dSYM [macOS Monterey+, Xcode 13+]\nor\n$ symbols -arch x86_64 -noSources secret.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/secret [macOS before Monterey, Xcode before 13]\n...\nhint_find_the_secret_addresses_of_the_memory_leak\n...</code></pre><p>The leaked memory in this memgraph is definitely starting to sound interesting — it’s probably a specific leaked address. Let’s see which secret addresses the hint is referring to. To determine if the “secret” app was leaking memory, you can check the memgraph for leaks with the <code>leaks</code> command line tool.</p>\n<p>You’ll want to pay attention to this portion of the output: </p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code>$ leaks secret.memgraph\n...\nSTACK OF 5 INSTANCES OF &#x27;ROOT LEAK: <span class=\"syntax-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"syntax-name\">CFArray</span>&gt;</span>&#x27;:\n6   hint                               0x7fff204edf3d how would you translate secret Addresses TO Symbols? + 1\n5   secret                                0x10d267ee8 0x10d264000 + 16104\n4   secret                                0x10d267dc5 0x10d264000 + 15813\n3   secret                                0x10d267ccf 0x10d264000 + 15567\n2   com.apple.CoreFoundation           0x7fff2059576f __CFArrayCreateInit + 190\n1   com.apple.CoreFoundation           0x7fff2054df07 _CFRuntimeCreateInstance + 587\n0   libsystem_malloc.dylib             0x7fff20314071 _malloc_zone_malloc + 242 \n...</code></pre><p>In this output, you’ll spot five leaks, all of which originated from the same place in code. They are united by the same call stack backtrace each time a <code>CFArray</code> was allocated, but never freed. You’ll find three secret addresses here — <code>0x10d267ee8</code>, <code>0x10d267dc5</code> and <code>0x10d267ccf</code> — along with a new hint sporting some interesting capitalization. This clue hints that you should try and use <code>atos</code> tool to symbolicate the secret addresses.</p>\n<p>To call <code>atos</code>, you need several components: The DWARF binary in the dSYM, architecture, and addresses to symbolicate. You’re missing the load address, however, and can find it for the “secret” binary image within the call stack of the leaks next to all three secret addresses: <code>0x10d264000</code>.

Are we doing all that we can?” I realized we had room to improve. We started integrating VoiceOver, then worked with blind people to improve that.

How did you create that feature?</strong>\nWe got a lot of suggestions from people who were in lectures all day. Their recordings were three or four hours long because they forgot to stop recording when there was a break, and they’d have to scrub through those 30 minutes or whatever it was. So we put our thinking caps on and looked into machine learning. We struggled with that! But when Core ML released, one of our guys sat down and went through thousands of hours of audio to train it.

One person isn’t a symphony — you need everyone to play. When your app gets out the door, that’s the start of the whole thing, not the end. You need people in customer support.

After you tap the big red button, anything you type — “launch update,” “convoluted calculus formula,” “funniest quote of the interview” — is automatically time-stamped.With its mix of audio and text, *Noted* is one of the most powerful note-taking apps in the galaxy.We caught up with Yuen to talk about his app’s growth, Michelle Obama’s inspiring words at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), and the challenge of getting artificial intelligence to understand with silence.\nYou’ve said you and your cofounder were inspired by a very long meeting…\nWe were! When we came out, he said, “Do you remember the time they mentioned this and that?” I sent him the recording, but neither of us could remember the timeline. We thought, “Why can’t we marry note-taking and audio recording, so when someone asks for that time, you can tap back to a hashtag? That was the core of the idea.\nAfter you launched, where did you see Noted used most?\nClasses and meetings. We got a lot of images from users in lecture halls and conferences, including WWDC. Journalists use it all the time; songwriters use it to write lyrics and play them back.Add time stamps and hashtags to key moments in your recordings.What surprised you about how people were using Noted?\nOne thing was hearing from users who are blind. Then, in 2017, we heard Michelle Obama talk at WWDC about imagining someone, somewhere, whom you could lift up with your work. I asked myself, “Are we really building for everyone? Are we doing all that we can?” I realized we had room to improve. We started integrating VoiceOver, then worked with blind people to improve that. A teacher at a school in New Zealand reached out to help her kids take notes during class. This is something that touches our hearts.\nNoted can automatically skip over long silences in your recordings. How did you create that feature?\nWe got a lot of suggestions from people who were in lectures all day. Their recordings were three or four hours long because they forgot to stop recording when there was a break, and they’d have to scrub through those 30 minutes or whatever it was. So we put our thinking caps on and looked into machine learning. We struggled with that! But when Core ML released, one of our guys sat down and went through thousands of hours of audio to train it. We knew it was doable.\nWhat advice would you give to developers who are just starting out?\nYou can’t do everything yourself. One person isn’t a symphony — you need everyone to play. When your app gets out the door, that’s the start of the whole thing, not the end. You need people in customer support. You need people in design. You need marketing people, you need engineers. You need different types of people to do distinct things.Download Noted from the App StoreLearn more about the App Store Small Business Program","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vvruahyb","isoDate":"2021-07-23T15:00:58.000Z"},{"title":"Tax Category Setting Now Available in App Store Connect","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=2bbbudbw","pubDate":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 13:20:31 PDT","content":"<p>The App Store makes it easy for you to manage transactions in 175 territories, and Apple administers tax on behalf of developers in 64 of those territories.

DocC also powers the interactive developer tutorials featured on developer.apple.com. In this challenge, we invite you to explore the tutorial functionality and design and build step-by-step instructions for an existing project you’ve created or an open source Swift package.</p><h3>Begin the challenge</h3><p>To get started writing a tutorial, add a Documentation Catalog to your existing project, or create a new framework project. </p>\n<p>You’ll write your tutorial content in Markdown, and use directives to define specific types of pages and elements, like introductions, sections, steps, and assessments. Then, use the Build Documentation feature of Xcode — which runs the DocC compiler — to render your tutorial in a rich, interactive learning format.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img

packages and displays it right in the Xcode documentation window. DocC also powers the interactive developer tutorials featured on developer.apple.com. In this challenge, we invite you to explore the tutorial functionality and design and build step-by-step instructions for an existing project you’ve created or an open source Swift package.Begin the challengeTo get started writing a tutorial, add a Documentation Catalog to your existing project, or create a new framework project. \nYou’ll write your tutorial content in Markdown, and use directives to define specific types of pages and elements, like introductions, sections, steps, and assessments. Then, use the Build Documentation feature of Xcode — which runs the DocC compiler — to render your tutorial in a rich, interactive learning format.Resources\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWDC21 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMeet DocC documentation in Xcode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreate great documentation with DocC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWDC21 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuild interactive tutorials using DocC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWDC21 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElevate your DocC documentation in Xcode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVisit the Apple Developer ForumsBuilding an Interactive TutorialSlothCreator: Building DocC Documentation in XcodeRead the WWDC21 Challenges Terms and Conditions","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ta87bwxi","isoDate":"2021-06-11T05:00:30.000Z"},{"title":"WWDC21 Daily Digest: Day 5","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=0dnsrl66","pubDate":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 21:00:58 PDT","content":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/554F5770-F29B-4AE0-A5D6-870E5332DABF/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"A Memoji staring into the screen of a MacBook Pro. \"></div><p>This is it!

Challenge yourself to solve this puzzle while getting familiar with VoiceOver, an assistive technology for people who are blind and low-vision. VoiceOver is a screen reader that allows people who are blind and low-vision to completely operate Apple’s products. On iOS, people can touch and swipe on the screen in order to navigate items, with each item’s name and status spoken aloud using synthesized speech. </p>\n<p>In this challenge, we invite you to escape the maze of Castle Park. But there’s a catch: There is no visual interface in this iOS app! You must rely completely on VoiceOver to navigate the maze and escape.</p><h3>How to enable VoiceOver</h3><p>You have a few options to enable or disable VoiceOver. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can ask Siri to turn VoiceOver on or off for you at anytime. </li>\n<li>You can use the Accessibility Shortcut in <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility</strong> and set the shortcut to <strong>VoiceOver</strong>.

Challenge yourself to solve this puzzle while getting familiar with VoiceOver, an assistive technology for people who are blind and low-vision. VoiceOver is a screen reader that allows people who are blind and low-vision to completely operate Apple’s products. On iOS, people can touch and swipe on the screen in order to navigate items, with each item’s name and status spoken aloud using synthesized speech. \nIn this challenge, we invite you to escape the maze of Castle Park. But there’s a catch: There is no visual interface in this iOS app! You must rely completely on VoiceOver to navigate the maze and escape.How to enable VoiceOverYou have a few options to enable or disable VoiceOver. \n\nYou can ask Siri to turn VoiceOver on or off for you at anytime. \nYou can use the Accessibility Shortcut in Settings > Accessibility and set the shortcut to VoiceOver. Now, when you triple click the side button (or Home button, depending on your device), you can quickly turn VoiceOver on or off.\nBegin the challengeTo start this accessibility challenge, download the Xcode project linked below and run it on iPhone or iPad.

Most of us have experienced playing games where we have unlocked some kind of achievement or trophy that stirs some of these emotions. This is exactly what we want you to consider when you create Game Center achievements for your apps or games — and now, we’re challenging you to show the developer community your best, funniest, strangest, and most delightful achievements.</p><h3>Begin the challenge</h3><p>This achievements challenge focuses on sequencing achievements to encourage people to complete a specific set of tasks. Progress-based achievements are the most common types of rewards players can earn, and coupling some of them together can help create an even stronger narrative within your app or game.</p>\n<p>Whether your game is divided into chapters, levels, or some other way, today’s challenge is to create a series of at least 2-3 achievements that break up the narrative in a unique and interesting way. Think about how you might add titles and descriptions in both the locked and unlocked versions of the achievement that indicate to the player these are connected together and need to be unlocked in that specific order. (And as always, bonus points for puns and amazing alliteration.)</p>\n<p>We welcome all achievements, new, old, existing, or imaginary: Show off your “Series Finale” achievements from one of your existing apps or games, or put your wordsmithery to work and create an entirely new set of achievements. You can share these with the developer community on the Developer Forums.</p>\n<p>Best of all, we’ve made it easy for you to participate and dream up awesome achievements even if you haven’t yet implemented Game Center or you want to try writing something entirely new: Just download the attached Game Center achievement template.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/forums/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Visit the Apple Developer Forums</a></p><h3>Best practices for great achievements</h3><p>It’s a lot of fun to create unique and engaging achievements to connect people with your app or game. Below are a few of our recommendations when thinking about writing and designing achievements.</p>\n<p><strong>Be creative with an achievement’s title, but straightforward with its description</strong>\nAlthough most people appreciate entertaining titles, they expect an achievement’s description to specify how to earn it.

Most of us have experienced playing games where we have unlocked some kind of achievement or trophy that stirs some of these emotions. This is exactly what we want you to consider when you create Game Center achievements for your apps or games — and now, we’re challenging you to show the developer community your best, funniest, strangest, and most delightful achievements.Begin the challengeThis achievements challenge focuses on sequencing achievements to encourage people to complete a specific set of tasks. Progress-based achievements are the most common types of rewards players can earn, and coupling some of them together can help create an even stronger narrative within your app or game.\nWhether your game is divided into chapters, levels, or some other way, today’s challenge is to create a series of at least 2-3 achievements that break up the narrative in a unique and interesting way. Think about how you might add titles and descriptions in both the locked and unlocked versions of the achievement that indicate to the player these are connected together and need to be unlocked in that specific order. (And as always, bonus points for puns and amazing alliteration.)\nWe welcome all achievements, new, old, existing, or imaginary: Show off your “Series Finale” achievements from one of your existing apps or games, or put your wordsmithery to work and create an entirely new set of achievements. You can share these with the developer community on the Developer Forums.\nBest of all, we’ve made it easy for you to participate and dream up awesome achievements even if you haven’t yet implemented Game Center or you want to try writing something entirely new: Just download the attached Game Center achievement template.Visit the Apple Developer ForumsBest practices for great achievementsIt’s a lot of fun to create unique and engaging achievements to connect people with your app or game. Below are a few of our recommendations when thinking about writing and designing achievements.\nBe creative with an achievement’s title, but straightforward with its description\nAlthough most people appreciate entertaining titles, they expect an achievement’s description to specify how to earn it. If you were to create a WWDC21 achievement, for instance, you might write the following:Title: Code Completionist\nDescription: Watched every WWDC21 Code-Along session.Be succinct\nThe Game Center achievement card limits your title and description to two lines each before truncating the text — brevity is key to a great achievement.\nThink inclusively\nFollow the Human Interface Guidelines around inclusivity when creating achievements. The best jokes, puns, and wordplay are those that are intuitive and friendly to everyone who might interact with your app or game, and make players feel recognized and rewarded.\nAdd unique, high-quality images\nPeople appreciate earning unique achievements that remind them of each accomplishment. When you create custom artwork, you can help that achievement stand out from the others in your app or game and make it more recognizable to people who interact with it. \nYou can learn more about how to design great achievements in Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines, and in the WWDC20 session “Design for Game Center.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWDC20 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDesign for Game Center\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload the Achievement Unlocked Challenge materialLearn more about designing achievementsRead the WWDC21 Challenges Terms and Conditions","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g1c0adgk","isoDate":"2021-06-10T13:30:51.000Z"},{"title":"Challenge: Focus on Focus APIs in SwiftUI","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=yudyoi9z","pubDate":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 06:30:24 PDT","content":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F78F6C27-DB66-477E-9FF5-2ACA87491049/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"Image showing three text fields with one in focus\"></div><p>With device input — as with all things in life — where you put your focus matters.

If a person using your app is on a lower-bandwidth connection, your app can download or deliver files appropriate for that network; likewise, you can deliver higher-bandwidth assets when the connection supports it so that you can provide more information quickly. You can apply this to multiple different types of apps, including:</p>\n<p><strong>Streaming apps</strong>\nVideo streaming apps can incorporate intelligent buffering and playback with AVFoundation to serve 4K (or 4K HDR) content to devices on 5G networks as well as lower-bandwidth options when connected to LTE.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about AV Foundation</a></p><p><strong>Games</strong>\nUse the bandwidth available on 5G networks to deliver higher quality visuals and game play with larger texture maps and higher-poly models than you might otherwise on lower-bandwidth networks. Additionally, 5G’s lower-latency connection provides for faster overall play and state-saving actions between players and your server backend.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/scenekit/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about SceneKit</a></p><p><strong>Machine Learning apps</strong>\nIf your app uses Core ML, you can improve both the speed and reliability of your on-device intelligence when connected to a 5G network by automatically retrieving larger .mlmodel and .mlarchive files from your server to run locally on someone’s device.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Core ML</a></p><p><strong>AR apps</strong>\nWhile on 5G, you can provide a greater number of high-resolution objects within your ARKit scenes to provide a richer augmented experience for people interacting with your app. You can also use the extra bandwidth available over 5G networks to share even larger ARWorldMap and ARPointCloud objects in a shared AR experience — for instance, working collaboratively to lay out physical spaces with virtual objects from your app.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">ARKit</a></p><h3>Tune your transfers</h3><p>Apple networking APIs automatically provide optimized management and performance for each platform and network type. In addition, you can further optimize your app to address potential cellular issues like movement speed and direction, cellular infrastructure demand, and interference.</p>\n<p><strong>Forget the network</strong>\nBecause 5G networks typically offer better performance than Wi-Fi, it’s up to you to decide how your app best utilizes network resources — and you no longer need to rely on overall network type (cellular or Wi-Fi) to do so. Instead, you can use Constrained and Expensive to describe various network states. Each of these states relies on information from a person’s Data Mode choices (as defined in <strong>Settings &gt; Cellular &gt; Cellular Data Options</strong>) as well as their cellular plan restrictions.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/3240635-isexpensive\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">isExpensive</a></p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/3240628-isconstrained\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">isConstrained</a></p><p>For example, the network automatically switches to Constrained when someone enables Low Data Mode. When a person’s network is listed as Constrained, your app should minimize network data usage regardless of the value of Expensive. If the network is Expensive but not Constrained, your app should be considerate when fetching network resources while not imposing strict restraints. If the network is neither Constrained nor Expensive, your app can focus on providing the highest quality experience with minimal consideration for data usage.</p>\n<p>Each networking framework uses the Constrained and Expensive indicators in specific ways. When using URLRequest, for example, your app can indicate which resource should be retrieved by setting the appropriate value on the <code>allowsConstrainedNetworkAccess</code> and <code>allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess</code> properties. In contrast, when using NWConnection, your app can access the state of the network through <code>stateUpdateHandler</code> as the <code>isConstrained</code> <code>isExpensive</code> properties of your connection’s currentPath. And, if your app uses AVFoundation instead of the Network framework or URLRequest, there are similar keys including <code>AVURLAssetAllowsConstrainedNetworkAccessKey</code> and <code>AVURLAssetAllowsExpensiveNetworkAccessKey</code>.</p>\n<p>Regardless of technique, remember that the values for Constrained and Expensive are transient and can change as someone moves from one type of network connection to another. If your app dynamically monitors these changes, you’ll always provide the best experience for people, no matter their connection.</p>\n<p><strong>Provide a fallback</strong>\nUnless your app is designed specifically for a network with guaranteed performance characteristics, like a corporate or private connection, you should always make sure it functions well — even when there’s no network available at all. When someone initially downloads your app, make sure it delivers acceptable-quality assets as part of the bundle. If the app has periods of fast connectivity, you can then download higher-quality files and store them locally to ensure they're available when someone leaves network range or goes offline entirely.</p>\n<p><strong>Support your surroundings</strong>\nMost cellular providers have prioritized 5G rollouts in high-density areas: entertainment venues such as sports stadiums and amphitheaters, transportation hubs like train stations and airports, centers for business and education, and points of interest like public parks and tourist landmarks. When people recognize they’re in a high-performance networking location, they may want to explicitly enable caching and other features in your app before heading to a destination with reduced coverage — consider incorporating interface elements that notify and enable people to immediately download any relevant content </p>\n<p><strong>Take advantage of built-in frameworks</strong>\nApple’s hardware and on-device frameworks are tuned to deliver advanced functionality in a power-efficient manner. For example, you can use Core ML for on-device intelligence instead of client-server round trips, or ARKit and the Vision framework for capturing, processing, and presenting insightful information in the field. On-device processing minimizes the need to exchange large amounts of data — let alone potentially personally identifiable information — and eliminates the need for having to connect to a back-end process in order to provide a useful service in your app.</p>\n<p>When you do need to move large amounts of data, you can lean on Smart Data Mode for 5G-enabled devices. This feature monitors your app’s state along with any Apple frameworks you’re currently using to automatically switch between existing cellular frequencies in a manner that ensures your app receives the highest possible bandwidth — all without sacrificing battery life.</p>\n<p>For example, when an app is in the foreground and playing video using the AVFoundation framework, Smart Data Mode ensures that high-bandwidth 5G is enabled. In addition, Smart Data Mode monitors the streaming experience while someone is connected to a 5G network. If the stream is throttled due to traffic shaping — either by the cellular provider or the limitations of your CDN — the feature will identify the throttled throughput and move the stream to an LTE connection to conserve power. Background requests for data using the core networking frameworks can be served just as well over LTE or lower power frequencies.</p><h3>Get out there</h3><p>Previously, testing your app’s networking code involved toggling the network state, switching between Wi-Fi and cellular data, and then using a network conditioner and other tools to alter various characteristics. While this is still a great way to test for basic use cases, nothing beats getting out and exploring the edge-case scenarios only a deployed network can throw your way.</p>\n<p><strong>Start small</strong>\nThe App Store has a variety of apps you can use to determine the network characteristics for a given area. With one of these apps and a regional carrier’s wireless coverage map, you can track down the perfect spots in your area to ensure your app is selecting the correct resources at the right time. And once you’ve found that perfect 5G networking spot, move to another where your coverage is sub-optimal and check your app. Did it keep running? Did your streaming content degrade as expected or move to local resources? Did it deliver acceptable-quality assets after fresh install? The more real-world use cases you can test in advance, the better the experience overall will be for people around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Go big</strong>\nWhile many third-party websites provide performance data for cellular networks, they are an aggregate statistic and only an approximation of the performance at the location where someone might be using your app. Because this data is only valuable as a baseline, it’s not a substitute for knowing how your app performs in the wild. You can use Testflight for iOS to scale your beta testing to people and networks around the world. You may also want to consider creating a TestFlight group — not only to ensure your app is bug-free, but that it performs well based on the overall network characteristics of the cohort you’ve assembled.</p>\n<p><strong>Move to the edge</strong>\nWhile the location of your server isn’t something you can always control, at least try to influence or decide where your server infrastructure resides and take steps to minimize the distance between your server and your app. When you reduce the distance between people and your backend, it can vastly improve the network performance of your app. One way you can improve your own app’s connection is by selecting a hosting provider that can federate your server back-end to map closely to the cellular networks your app uses.

to meditate (even if you’re fidgety)</h3><p>At 11 a.m. PDT, hear from special guest speaker Dan Harris, an Emmy-winning journalist, Good Morning America anchor and author of the best-selling book Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics. After having a nationally televised panic attack in 2004, Harris found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with the discovery of mindfulness meditation. Today, Harris will discuss his journey, as well as the books, podcast, and app that have helped millions manage the stress and anxieties of today’s world—including previous non-believers like himself.

After having a nationally televised panic attack in 2004, Harris found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with the discovery of mindfulness meditation. Today, Harris will discuss his journey, as well as the books, podcast, and app that have helped millions manage the stress and anxieties of today’s world—including previous non-believers like himself.

You can use audio data (frequency, volume) from the microphone, light data (color, brightness) from the camera, and also gyroscope data (movement in X, Y, Z coordinates) from the motion sensor of the device. The book has some great reference material to help you get started: Check out “Using Device Motion,” “Using Light to Play Sound,” “Clappy Fish,” and “Synesthesia.”</p>\n<p>Think about the types of things you could decipher about your environment based upon this sensor data.

What challenges, if any, would there be to adopt this new approach into your solution? \nIf you are a developer of an MDM solution, you can consider how this integrates into your existing product. If you don’t have an existing MDM solution but are considering building a new one for general or specific use, how can declarative device management accelerate your development?  \nIf you’re a device administrator at an organization, consider how you would want your MDM solution to adapt to the new paradigm. And consider those who use managed devices. How might this improve their experience?

We asked several of our Apple Design Award-nominated developers to share their philosophy around making music, audio design, and sound. (And occasionally frogs.)</p><h3>Poolsuite FM: Hot fun in the summertime</h3><p>Let’s just come right out and say it: <em>Poolsuite FM</em> is the perfect summer mood. This bitmapped, genre-hopping, beach party jukebox immerses you in 90s design nostalgia while maintaining a great technical experience behind the scenes. And it was invented not by a reggae artist or an Ibiza DJ but an affable Scot named Marty Bell who, prior to developing his poolside player, had no musical training, no tech background, no money to hire help, and — this part is key — definitely no pool.</p>\n<p>What he <em>did</em> have was the keen idea to synthesize that summer feeling and his well-honed ability to curate music that sounds like sunshine. “I have a pool in my head,” Bell says. “I imagine 10 people hanging out. They’re all way cooler than me. And I think, ‘OK, would I play this song in that scenario?’” he laughs. “The stakes are really high.”</p>\n<p><em>Poolsuite FM</em> (known until very recently as <em>Poolside FM</em>) was conceived during the uncommonly dismal Scottish winter of 2014. “It was a very gray time,” Bell says from his home in the Scottish highlands (though he’d recently returned from a “seven-month Covid escape” to the Dominican Republic). “It was cold and spitting rain all the time. Listening to this music just boosted the serotonin in my brain.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/13E37E20-E41F-4FAC-BA93-095C8AEC8318/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"\"></div><p>Bell wanted to spread sunshine to others, but as a longtime party planner, he also knew that a simple playlist app would be a hard sell. “Everybody thinks they have the best playlist,” he laughs. “I thought, ‘Why don’t I take this summer thing that makes me feel happy and pair with something else that makes me feel happy: cheesy ‘80s beach movies on VHS?”</p>\n<p>Properly drenched in technological nostalgia and positive vibrations, <em>Poolsuite FM</em> made an instant splash. Its look mirrored the Mac you had in 1994; its playlists were curated by Bell and often drawn from under-the-radar artists on Soundcloud and YouTube; and its sound was decidedly all over the map. “There’s disco, indie rock, and electronic music,” he says, “but I feel like it’s all in the same family.”</p>\n<p>Today, <em>Poolsuite FM</em> has a deep well of stations like Indie Summer, Hangover Club, Tokyo Disco, and Friday Nite Heat. Its primary channel has 600 tracks; Bell adds a dozen or so every week through his own curation and submissions he gets on social media. “I’d far prefer <em>Poolsuite</em> to be bursting with artists people had never heard of,” he says. </p>\n<p>And there’s one last surprise: <em>Poolsuite FM</em> has never monetized. Bell relies on volunteer help; to start bringing in money, he’s launched a sunscreen line. “I don’t ever want to monetize <em>Poolsuite</em>,” he says. “I don’t want to track metrics and KPIs and all that. It would kill the vibe.” And summer is nothing if not a vibe.</p><hr><h3>If Found: Intergalactic planetary</h3><p><em>If Found</em> isn’t like any other game. Or app. (Frankly we’re still working out what to call it.) It’s an immersive sci-fi coming-of-age story centered around a journal kept by its protagonist, a young transgender woman named Kasio. To (greatly) simplify the experience, you progress through the story by erasing each scene with your finger, gradually unifying the (seemingly very disparate) narrative strands as you scrub. All the while, you’re gently guided along by audio designers/composers Eli Rainsberry and Matt Hopkins.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to get the feeling that you could open this journal and hear everything in your head, like you were daydreaming,” says Rainsberry.</p>\n<p>A gaming industry vet whose work can also be heard on <em>Bird Alone, A Monster’s Expedition</em>, and <em>Wilmot’s Warehouse,</em> Rainsberry strongly connected with <em>If Found’</em>s subtler, more emotional “notebook” sequences. “That’s where I could work more intimately with the erasing system,” they say. “The cliffside scenes start with softer winds; as Kasio moves along in the story, things gets colder and thinner.” Rainsberry felt the arc of the notebook scenes called for an analog approach, one heavy on acoustic guitar, mandolin, and harmonica. “I wanted to replicate memories fading away,” they say. </p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/1888D50A-6486-4C27-BDDA-25A893C3623F/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"\"></div><p>Hopkins, who records under the moniker 2 Mello, composed the more dramatic scenes — including a cinematic and celestial opening sequence, which drops you into deep space and gradually compels you to erase entire planets (and then something even bigger).</p>\n<p>To do so, he drew on 90s electronica, leaning in equally to the frenetic roar of The Prodigy and the more analog approach of Aphex Twin. “It’s pretty rare that you get asked to do anything that sounds like pop music for a video game,” he says. “It’s usually more about emotions and mood. But that was my inspiration this time. I even managed to sneak a little breakbeat in there.” </p>\n<p>If this all sounds a little mysterious, that’s the idea: <em>If Found’s</em> storylines weave around each other like ribbons, coalescing in an ending that also unifies the pair’s work. “I sampled some of Eli’s stuff there, where the notebook is constantly switching places with real life,” says Hopkins. Rainsberry has their own notes about it: “I provide quiet moments to give people space to process what’s going on, and then Matt comes in with incredible climax music. It’s a really nice balance.”</p><hr><h3>Pok Pok Playroom: The kids are alright</h3><p>While crafting the inventive children’s sandbox <em>Pok Pok Playroom</em>, Esther Huybreghts and Mathijs Demaeght made a solemn vow: “We wanted something parents wouldn’t have to mute in a restaurant,” Huybreghts laughs. “We didn’t want media and jingles and jangles that get stuck in your head. We wanted a quieter experience.”</p>\n<p>To the delight of grown-up diners everywhere, they got it: <em>Pok Pok Playroom</em> is a tasteful feast for little senses. There are hand-drawn switches to flip, gears to grind, blobs to plop together, and bells to ring. But they’re all done with a judicious aural balance that activates young minds while also leaving space for kids to fill in details with their own imaginations. That’s all thanks of sound designer Matt Miller, who took initial audio ideas from Demaeght and jumped into the project with his entire … well, mouth.</p>\n<p>“I started by making little sounds: ‘choo choo, quack quack,’” says the Toronto-based Miller. “It was all very embarrassing.” </p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C2D91CD9-0F2E-4F82-BE5C-4C2641CFB671/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"\"></div><p>It also worked. Miller went on to record every sound in the <em>Playroom</em>: all the sloshing mops, sizzling grills, and wordless dialogue were entirely provided by he and his wife, Cathy. “The idea was to create calming sounds,” says Miller, “something that could be heard a number of times without becoming fatiguing.” (Here we’ll give parents and caregivers a moment to nod appreciatively.)</p>\n<p>Initially, Miller and Demaeght wanted to use a small number of real-world objects, but they quickly realized that the app’s 500 animations required a broader arsenal of sounds — so Miller went on a hunt. “I got wooden blocks, pots from the kitchen, stuff I bought at a local thrift store,” Miller says, pointing to a boxes of “Foley objects” in the background of his home studio. “I’d just walk into a music store and start pinging on things.” </p>\n<p>His biggest challenge came in the app’s “musical blobs” section — an abstract playspace of movable shapes. “A musical blob is a completely new idea,” Miller says. “A lot has to come together for that to work.” For instance: The color blue is always a C, while circles (the simplest of shapes) are represented by a single sine wave (the simplest of sounds). “There needs to be a consistency,” says Miller. </p>\n<p>But like his target audience, Miller also found room for a little play: One of his favorite effects involves a dung beetle that raises its back legs and rolls the dung away. “That rolling sound is just me rolling over the edges of a soup can,” he laughs. “When we can be literal, we’re literal. But it’s fun to throw curveballs, too.”</p><hr><h3>Loona: Night time is the right time</h3><p>One workday morning last year, <em>Loona</em> founder Andrew Yanchurevich texted team sound director Ivan Senkevich to ask why he wasn’t in the office yet. Luckily, Senkevich had very good answer: He was out looking for frogs. </p>\n<p>More specifically, Senkevich was looking for the <em>sounds</em> of frogs — recordings he could integrate into his team’s sleep app. “My region has a great natural sound,” says Senkevich of the area around his hometown of Minsk, Belarus. “I came into my village often to record.”</p>\n<p>He had plenty of reason to do so. Part bedtime story, part interactive activity, and all gorgeous, <em>Loona</em> is an app that winds you down with “sleepscapes” — blends of sound, story, and narration designed to soothe your mind at bedtime. (Think of them as meditative interactive storybooks.) </p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/75E84CD8-2B80-441D-8449-F05240B22A81/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"\"></div><p>To create the appropriately somnolent aural environment, Senkevich often hit the road, traveling around town in search of not just amphibian friends but breezy forests, babbling rivers, and the buzz of insect life. “Some of the sleepscapes are more cartoonish and some more realistic. But we always try to show the natural-ness of the sound.” (Some sounds, he notes, did come from libraries. “You can’t record the sea in Minsk,” Senkevich says with a laugh.)</p>\n<p>Sound is a crucial ingredient in <em>Loona</em>’s restful recipe of art, storytelling, graphics, music, and sleep science. To hear Yanchurevich tell it, that magical mix is driven by Senkevich’s history in both graphics and audio design. “Ivan came to us with experience in both,” says Yanchurevich. “He feels that connection between two worlds. That’s his superpower.” </p>\n<p>The resulting app is designed, as Yanchurevich says, to “recreate this safe bubble from your childhood.” In the introductory sleepscape “The Dragon’s Shrine,” you’ll explore a beautifully-rendered marble pagoda while an appropriately-mellifluous voice guides you through calming, repetitive tasks like lighting lanterns and coloring in architectural details. As you progress through sleepscapes, you’ll lose yourself in a fairytale kingdom, explore a dark forest (which sounds a lot like Minsk), or simply cozy up to a crackling fire. Music comes from a team of sound freelance musicians that stretches from Brazil to Asia to the United States and incorporates the culture of each. But the final product is a single design. “We try to present the graphics and audio as one thought,” Senkevich says.</p><hr><h3>NaadSadhana: Extraordinary machine</h3><p><em>NaadSadhana</em> is the sort of astonishing, future-world app that could only be created by someone with an extremely specialized, almost-impossible skill set.</p>\n<p>Sandeep Ranade was that someone.</p>\n<p>With the help of AI, the app listens as you improvise a vocal line, then generates a backing track to match — all in real time. <em>NaadSadhana</em> (a mix of the Sanskrit words for “essence of sound” and “systemic practice”) has neither stock riffs nor repeating loops; its 10 instruments, including virtual tanpura, tabla, and harmonium, are as spontaneous as your vocals. And with features like visual biofeedback, it’s a powerful tool for blind or hard-of-hearing people.</p>\n<p>Ranade was perfectly positioned to create such a project. The Pune-based developer began singing at 4; by the 11th grade, he was an excellent singer who also exhibited skill in software engineering. “I needed to decide whether to go into either software or music,” Ranade says, “and I decided I wanted to do both professionally.”</p>\n<p>He pursued that dual track for years (as well as a few others: Ranade has a masters from Johns Hopkins, two decades of tech-world experience, and a thriving career as a Hindustani classical vocalist). All the while, he kept teaching, but inefficiencies in the process nagged at him. Training for Indian classical singing is an intense and demanding process; in the “ancient system,” Ranade says, students would live with their teachers and practice for 10 hours a day, every day. Today, that timing isn’t possible, but the work remains the same.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/33A220F8-6735-4C07-B9E6-F56D88F465F5/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"\"></div><p>“If you don’t have frequent course correction, your neural pathways won’t converge to where they need to be,” he says. “I needed something that would tell students, ‘You’re just a little bit flat here, a little sharp there.’” Unable to find a solution — and despite having no background in Swift, Xcode, AI, graphic design, or designing mobile apps — he set out to build it himself. </p>\n<p>From there, Ranade began tweaking. He added an AI to detect what was singing and what was not, but felt room for more. “I wanted accompaniment,” he says. “Instruments like a swarmandal, which has 40 strings, are hard to tune and travel with. I thought, ‘What if something could play close to as well as I can, stay in tune, and fit on my phone?’”</p>\n<p>He gave the app a test run by recording “Na Corona Karo,” a song about taking precautions against COVID-19 that became a viral hit shared by A.R. Rahman and others. But Ranade was most moved by the reaction he got from the leaders in his field. “Musical geniuses like my late guru thought it was real human accompaniment,” he says. “They were astonished it was software.”</p>\n<p>Today, <em>NadSaadhana</em> features automatic harmonies on violin, piano, and harmonium as well as percussion instruments like shakers and ankle bells. Its AI is trained not to adjust to the complexities of each instrument, but to the mix of the orchestra and the mood of the singer. “It’s not as simple as ‘This is the note he’s singing, so here are the chords,’” Ranade says. “There has to be context: Is he singing slower or faster? Does he sound sadder or more upbeat? That changes the chords you hear, from all the thousands possible.” Some bands rage against machines; Ranade’s future is working more closely with them.</p>","contentSnippet":"An immersive app doesn’t just look or feel great: It has to sound amazing, too. We asked several of our Apple Design Award-nominated developers to share their philosophy around making music, audio design, and sound. (And occasionally frogs.)Poolsuite FM: Hot fun in the summertimeLet’s just come right out and say it: Poolsuite FM is the perfect summer mood. This bitmapped, genre-hopping, beach party jukebox immerses you in 90s design nostalgia while maintaining a great technical experience behind the scenes. And it was invented not by a reggae artist or an Ibiza DJ but an affable Scot named Marty Bell who, prior to developing his poolside player, had no musical training, no tech background, no money to hire help, and — this part is key — definitely no pool.\nWhat he did have was the keen idea to synthesize that summer feeling and his well-honed ability to curate music that sounds like sunshine. “I have a pool in my head,” Bell says. “I imagine 10 people hanging out. They’re all way cooler than me. And I think, ‘OK, would I play this song in that scenario?’” he laughs. “The stakes are really high.”\nPoolsuite FM (known until very recently as Poolside FM) was conceived during the uncommonly dismal Scottish winter of 2014. “It was a very gray time,” Bell says from his home in the Scottish highlands (though he’d recently returned from a “seven-month Covid escape” to the Dominican Republic). “It was cold and spitting rain all the time. Listening to this music just boosted the serotonin in my brain.”Bell wanted to spread sunshine to others, but as a longtime party planner, he also knew that a simple playlist app would be a hard sell. “Everybody thinks they have the best playlist,” he laughs. “I thought, ‘Why don’t I take this summer thing that makes me feel happy and pair with something else that makes me feel happy: cheesy ‘80s beach movies on VHS?”\nProperly drenched in technological nostalgia and positive vibrations, Poolsuite FM made an instant splash. Its look mirrored the Mac you had in 1994; its playlists were curated by Bell and often drawn from under-the-radar artists on Soundcloud and YouTube; and its sound was decidedly all over the map. “There’s disco, indie rock, and electronic music,” he says, “but I feel like it’s all in the same family.”\nToday, Poolsuite FM has a deep well of stations like Indie Summer, Hangover Club, Tokyo Disco, and Friday Nite Heat. Its primary channel has 600 tracks; Bell adds a dozen or so every week through his own curation and submissions he gets on social media. “I’d far prefer Poolsuite to be bursting with artists people had never heard of,” he says. \nAnd there’s one last surprise: Poolsuite FM has never monetized. Bell relies on volunteer help; to start bringing in money, he’s launched a sunscreen line. “I don’t ever want to monetize Poolsuite,” he says. “I don’t want to track metrics and KPIs and all that. It would kill the vibe.” And summer is nothing if not a vibe.If Found: Intergalactic planetaryIf Found isn’t like any other game. Or app. (Frankly we’re still working out what to call it.) It’s an immersive sci-fi coming-of-age story centered around a journal kept by its protagonist, a young transgender woman named Kasio. To (greatly) simplify the experience, you progress through the story by erasing each scene with your finger, gradually unifying the (seemingly very disparate) narrative strands as you scrub. All the while, you’re gently guided along by audio designers/composers Eli Rainsberry and Matt Hopkins.\n“I wanted to get the feeling that you could open this journal and hear everything in your head, like you were daydreaming,” says Rainsberry.\nA gaming industry vet whose work can also be heard on Bird Alone, A Monster’s Expedition, and Wilmot’s Warehouse, Rainsberry strongly connected with If Found’s subtler, more emotional “notebook” sequences. “That’s where I could work more intimately with the erasing system,” they say. “The cliffside scenes start with softer winds; as Kasio moves along in the story, things gets colder and thinner.” Rainsberry felt the arc of the notebook scenes called for an analog approach, one heavy on acoustic guitar, mandolin, and harmonica. “I wanted to replicate memories fading away,” they say. Hopkins, who records under the moniker 2 Mello, composed the more dramatic scenes — including a cinematic and celestial opening sequence, which drops you into deep space and gradually compels you to erase entire planets (and then something even bigger).\nTo do so, he drew on 90s electronica, leaning in equally to the frenetic roar of The Prodigy and the more analog approach of Aphex Twin. “It’s pretty rare that you get asked to do anything that sounds like pop music for a video game,” he says. “It’s usually more about emotions and mood. But that was my inspiration this time. I even managed to sneak a little breakbeat in there.” \nIf this all sounds a little mysterious, that’s the idea: If Found’s storylines weave around each other like ribbons, coalescing in an ending that also unifies the pair’s work. “I sampled some of Eli’s stuff there, where the notebook is constantly switching places with real life,” says Hopkins. Rainsberry has their own notes about it: “I provide quiet moments to give people space to process what’s going on, and then Matt comes in with incredible climax music. It’s a really nice balance.”Pok Pok Playroom: The kids are alrightWhile crafting the inventive children’s sandbox Pok Pok Playroom, Esther Huybreghts and Mathijs Demaeght made a solemn vow: “We wanted something parents wouldn’t have to mute in a restaurant,” Huybreghts laughs. “We didn’t want media and jingles and jangles that get stuck in your head. We wanted a quieter experience.”\nTo the delight of grown-up diners everywhere, they got it: Pok Pok Playroom is a tasteful feast for little senses. There are hand-drawn switches to flip, gears to grind, blobs to plop together, and bells to ring. But they’re all done with a judicious aural balance that activates young minds while also leaving space for kids to fill in details with their own imaginations. That’s all thanks of sound designer Matt Miller, who took initial audio ideas from Demaeght and jumped into the project with his entire … well, mouth.\n“I started by making little sounds: ‘choo choo, quack quack,’” says the Toronto-based Miller. “It was all very embarrassing.” It also worked. Miller went on to record every sound in the Playroom: all the sloshing mops, sizzling grills, and wordless dialogue were entirely provided by he and his wife, Cathy. “The idea was to create calming sounds,” says Miller, “something that could be heard a number of times without becoming fatiguing.” (Here we’ll give parents and caregivers a moment to nod appreciatively.)\nInitially, Miller and Demaeght wanted to use a small number of real-world objects, but they quickly realized that the app’s 500 animations required a broader arsenal of sounds — so Miller went on a hunt. “I got wooden blocks, pots from the kitchen, stuff I bought at a local thrift store,” Miller says, pointing to a boxes of “Foley objects” in the background of his home studio. “I’d just walk into a music store and start pinging on things.” \nHis biggest challenge came in the app’s “musical blobs” section — an abstract playspace of movable shapes. “A musical blob is a completely new idea,” Miller says. “A lot has to come together for that to work.” For instance: The color blue is always a C, while circles (the simplest of shapes) are represented by a single sine wave (the simplest of sounds). “There needs to be a consistency,” says Miller. \nBut like his target audience, Miller also found room for a little play: One of his favorite effects involves a dung beetle that raises its back legs and rolls the dung away. “That rolling sound is just me rolling over the edges of a soup can,” he laughs. “When we can be literal, we’re literal.

When you create custom artwork, you can help that achievement stand out from the others in your app or game and make it more recognizable to people who interact with it. \nYou can learn more about how to design great achievements in Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines, and in the WWDC20 session “Design for Game Center.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWDC20 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDesign for Game Center\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload the Achievement Unlocked Challenge materialLearn more about designing achievementsRead the WWDC21 Challenges Terms and Conditions","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=jk5glh6l","isoDate":"2021-06-08T12:00:28.000Z"},{"title":"The music of WWDC21","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=uvphs45t","pubDate":"Tue, 08 Jun 2021 01:54:18 PDT","content":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/15FC250F-9885-49F8-9F8F-511917D453FF/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"Three Memoji on a black and purple background\"></div><p>WWDC is powered by three things: developers, ingenuity, and music.

pavilions, labs, and lounges</h3><p>The WWDC tab of the Developer app has everything you need to have a great online conference experience this year. Let’s take a brief tour.</p>\n<p><strong>Pop into a pavilion</strong>: With more than 200 sessions, labs, and activities, pavilions can help you find the most relevant content on the topics that matter most to you. Each pavilion contains a daily schedule with relevant sessions and labs, featured content and challenges, links to the Digital Lounges, and more.</p>\n<p>You can find our pavilions in the WWDC tab of the Developer app, listed below your personalized schedule. Explore the latest sessions and labs for Augmented Reality, seek out the latest in SwiftUI, or check out the demos and documentation from Developer Tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Lab life:</strong> Our Apple engineers and designers are here all week to help provide guidance and conversation around the latest frameworks, APIs, and best practices. Members of the Apple Developer Program, Apple Developer Enterprise Program, or 2021 Swift Student Challenge Winners can request a lab appointment. There are dozens of available labs every day — if you’re eligible to request an appointment, sign up now!</p>\n<p><strong>Hang out in a Digital Lounge:</strong> For more of a group experience, you can join the Digital Lounges and connect with Apple engineers and designers around select topics. We’re offering a small number of lounges this year, hosted by Developer Tools as well as engineers and designers from our SwiftUI, Accessibility, and Machine Learning teams. </p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/digital-lounges/register/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Register for the Digital Lounges</a></p><p><a href=\"https://wwdc21.slack.com/archives/C0231SS689M\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Visit the Accessibility Digital Lounge (Requires registration)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://wwdc21.slack.com/archives/C0239SDT26A\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Visit the Developer Tools Digital Lounge (Requires registration)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://wwdc21.slack.com/archives/C023V8R8WJD\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Visit the Machine Learning Digital Lounge (Requires registration)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://wwdc21.slack.com/archives/C0246E5AEEL\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Visit the SwiftUI Digital Lounge (Requires registration)</a></p><h3>Sessions, sessions, everywhere</h3><p>We’ve got more than 60 sessions arriving on Day 2 that feature Xcode Cloud, SharePlay, inclusive design, spatial audio, ShazamKit, and more.

Apple has likewise scaled its efforts to meet those threats, taking relentless steps forward to combat these risks to users and developers alike. </p>\n<p>It takes significant resources behind the scenes to ensure these bad actors can’t exploit users’ most sensitive information, from location to payment details. While it’s impossible to catch every act of fraud or ill intent before it happens, thanks to Apple’s industry-leading antifraud efforts, security experts agree the App Store is the safest place to find and download apps.* </p>\n<p>In 2020 alone, Apple’s combination of sophisticated technology and human expertise protected customers from more than $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions, preventing the attempted theft of their money, information, and time — and kept nearly a million risky and vulnerable new apps out of their hands. </p><h3>App Review</h3><p>The App Review team is an essential line of defense, carefully reviewing every app and every update to ensure they adhere to the App Store’s strong <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\">guidelines</a> on privacy, security, and spam. The guidelines have changed over time to respond to new threats and challenges, with the goal of protecting users and providing them with the very best experience on the App Store.</p>\n<p>Apple’s goal is always to get new apps onto the store. In 2020, the team assisted more than 180,000 new developers in launching apps. Sometimes this takes a few tries. An app might be unfinished or not functioning properly when it’s submitted for approval, or it might not yet have a sufficient mechanism for moderating user-generated content. In 2020, nearly 1 million problematic new apps, and an additional nearly 1 million app updates, were rejected or removed for a range of reasons like those. </p>\n<p>A smaller but significant set of these rejections was for egregious violations that could harm users or deeply diminish their experience. In 2020 alone, the App Review team rejected more than 48,000 apps for containing hidden or undocumented features, and more than 150,000 apps were rejected because they were found to be spam, copycats, or misleading to users in ways such as manipulating them into making a purchase. </p>\n<p>Some developers perform a bait and switch: fundamentally changing how the app works after review to evade guidelines and commit forbidden and even criminal actions. When such apps are discovered, they’re rejected or removed immediately from the store, and developers are notified of a 14-day appeals process before their accounts are permanently terminated. In 2020, about 95,000 apps were removed from the App Store for fraudulent violations, predominantly for these kind of bait-and-switch maneuvers. </p>\n<p>In just the last few months, for example, Apple has rejected or removed apps that switched functionality after initial review to become real-money gambling apps, predatory loan issuers, and pornography hubs; used in-game signals to facilitate drug purchasing; and rewarded users for broadcasting illicit and pornographic content via video chat.</p>\n<p>Another common reason apps are rejected is they simply ask for more user data than they need, or mishandle the data they do collect. In 2020, the App Review team rejected over 215,000 apps for those sorts of privacy violations. Apple believes privacy is a fundamental right, and this commitment is a major reason why users choose the App Store.</p>\n<p>Even with these stringent review safeguards in place, with 1.8 million apps on the App Store, problems still surface. Users can report problematic apps by choosing the <a href=\"https://reportaproblem.apple.com/\">Report a Problem</a> feature on the App Store or calling Apple Support, and developers can use either of those methods or additional channels like <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/\">Feedback Assistant</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/contact/\">Apple Developer Support</a>. </p><h3>Fraudulent Ratings and Reviews</h3><p>App Store ratings and reviews help many users make decisions about which apps to download, and developers rely on them to incorporate new features that respond to user feedback. Apple relies on a sophisticated system that combines machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human review by expert teams to moderate these ratings and reviews to help ensure accuracy and maintain trust. Since 2020, Apple has processed over 1 billion ratings and over 100 million reviews, and over 250 million ratings and reviews were removed for not meeting moderation standards.</p>\n<p>Apple also recently deployed new tools to verify rating and review account authenticity, to analyze written reviews for signs of fraud, and to ensure that content from deactivated accounts is removed.</p><h3>Account Fraud</h3><p>Unfortunately, sometimes developer accounts are created entirely for fraudulent purposes. If a developer violation is egregious or repeated, the offender is expelled from the Apple Developer Program and their account terminated. Apple terminated 470,000 developer accounts in 2020 and rejected an additional 205,000 developer enrollments over fraud concerns, preventing them from ever submitting an app to the store. </p>\n<p>Despite fraudsters’ sophisticated techniques to obscure their actions, Apple’s aggressive monitoring means these accounts are terminated, on average, less than a month after they are created. </p>\n<p>Apple’s work to ensure the safety of users who download apps extends even beyond the App Store. Over the last 12 months, Apple found and blocked nearly 110,000 illegitimate apps on pirate storefronts. These storefronts distribute malicious software often designed to resemble popular apps — or that modify popular apps without their developers’ authorization — while circumventing the App Store’s security protections.</p>\n<p>And in just the last month, Apple blocked more than 3.2 million instances of apps distributed illicitly through the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. The program is designed to allow companies and other large organizations to develop and privately distribute internal-use apps to their employees that aren’t available to the general public.

Apple has likewise scaled its efforts to meet those threats, taking relentless steps forward to combat these risks to users and developers alike. \nIt takes significant resources behind the scenes to ensure these bad actors can’t exploit users’ most sensitive information, from location to payment details. While it’s impossible to catch every act of fraud or ill intent before it happens, thanks to Apple’s industry-leading antifraud efforts, security experts agree the App Store is the safest place to find and download apps.* \nIn 2020 alone, Apple’s combination of sophisticated technology and human expertise protected customers from more than $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions, preventing the attempted theft of their money, information, and time — and kept nearly a million risky and vulnerable new apps out of their hands. App ReviewThe App Review team is an essential line of defense, carefully reviewing every app and every update to ensure they adhere to the App Store’s strong guidelines on privacy, security, and spam. The guidelines have changed over time to respond to new threats and challenges, with the goal of protecting users and providing them with the very best experience on the App Store.\nApple’s goal is always to get new apps onto the store. In 2020, the team assisted more than 180,000 new developers in launching apps. Sometimes this takes a few tries. An app might be unfinished or not functioning properly when it’s submitted for approval, or it might not yet have a sufficient mechanism for moderating user-generated content. In 2020, nearly 1 million problematic new apps, and an additional nearly 1 million app updates, were rejected or removed for a range of reasons like those. \nA smaller but significant set of these rejections was for egregious violations that could harm users or deeply diminish their experience. In 2020 alone, the App Review team rejected more than 48,000 apps for containing hidden or undocumented features, and more than 150,000 apps were rejected because they were found to be spam, copycats, or misleading to users in ways such as manipulating them into making a purchase. \nSome developers perform a bait and switch: fundamentally changing how the app works after review to evade guidelines and commit forbidden and even criminal actions. When such apps are discovered, they’re rejected or removed immediately from the store, and developers are notified of a 14-day appeals process before their accounts are permanently terminated. In 2020, about 95,000 apps were removed from the App Store for fraudulent violations, predominantly for these kind of bait-and-switch maneuvers. \nIn just the last few months, for example, Apple has rejected or removed apps that switched functionality after initial review to become real-money gambling apps, predatory loan issuers, and pornography hubs; used in-game signals to facilitate drug purchasing; and rewarded users for broadcasting illicit and pornographic content via video chat.\nAnother common reason apps are rejected is they simply ask for more user data than they need, or mishandle the data they do collect. In 2020, the App Review team rejected over 215,000 apps for those sorts of privacy violations. Apple believes privacy is a fundamental right, and this commitment is a major reason why users choose the App Store.\nEven with these stringent review safeguards in place, with 1.8 million apps on the App Store, problems still surface. Users can report problematic apps by choosing the Report a Problem feature on the App Store or calling Apple Support, and developers can use either of those methods or additional channels like Feedback Assistant and Apple Developer Support. Fraudulent Ratings and ReviewsApp Store ratings and reviews help many users make decisions about which apps to download, and developers rely on them to incorporate new features that respond to user feedback. Apple relies on a sophisticated system that combines machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human review by expert teams to moderate these ratings and reviews to help ensure accuracy and maintain trust. Since 2020, Apple has processed over 1 billion ratings and over 100 million reviews, and over 250 million ratings and reviews were removed for not meeting moderation standards.\nApple also recently deployed new tools to verify rating and review account authenticity, to analyze written reviews for signs of fraud, and to ensure that content from deactivated accounts is removed.Account FraudUnfortunately, sometimes developer accounts are created entirely for fraudulent purposes. If a developer violation is egregious or repeated, the offender is expelled from the Apple Developer Program and their account terminated. Apple terminated 470,000 developer accounts in 2020 and rejected an additional 205,000 developer enrollments over fraud concerns, preventing them from ever submitting an app to the store. \nDespite fraudsters’ sophisticated techniques to obscure their actions, Apple’s aggressive monitoring means these accounts are terminated, on average, less than a month after they are created. \nApple’s work to ensure the safety of users who download apps extends even beyond the App Store. Over the last 12 months, Apple found and blocked nearly 110,000 illegitimate apps on pirate storefronts. These storefronts distribute malicious software often designed to resemble popular apps — or that modify popular apps without their developers’ authorization — while circumventing the App Store’s security protections.\nAnd in just the last month, Apple blocked more than 3.2 million instances of apps distributed illicitly through the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. The program is designed to allow companies and other large organizations to develop and privately distribute internal-use apps to their employees that aren’t available to the general public. Fraudsters attempt to distribute apps via this method to circumvent the rigorous App Review process, or to implicate a legitimate enterprise by manipulating an insider to leak credentials needed to ship illicit content.\nIn addition to fraudulent developer accounts, Apple works to identify and deactivate fraudulent user accounts. In 2020 alone, Apple deactivated 244 million customer accounts due to fraudulent and abusive activity. In addition, 424 million attempted account creations were rejected because they displayed patterns consistent with fraudulent and abusive activity.Payment and Credit Card FraudFinancial information and transactions are some of the most sensitive data that users share online. Apple has invested significant resources in building more secure payment technologies like Apple Pay and StoreKit, which are used by more than 900,000 apps to sell goods and services on the App Store. For example, with Apple Pay, credit card numbers are never shared with merchants — eliminating a risk factor in the payment transaction process.\nWith online data breaches frustratingly common, these protections are an essential part of keeping users safe. But users may not realize that when their credit card information is breached or stolen from another source, fraudsters may turn to online marketplaces like the App Store to attempt to purchase digital goods and services that can be laundered or used for illicit purposes.\nApple focuses relentlessly on this kind of fraud as well. In 2020 alone, the fusion of sophisticated technology and human review prevented more than 3 million stolen cards from being used to purchase stolen goods and services and banned nearly 1 million accounts from transacting again. In total, Apple protected users from more than $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions in 2020. \nFrom App Review, to fraudulent account detection, to prevention of financial crimes, Apple works around the clock and behind the scenes to keep the App Store a safe and trusted place for users and developers alike.* nokia.com/networks/portfolio/cyber-security/threat-intelligence-report-2020; media.defense.gov","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=fdf4z73i","isoDate":"2021-05-11T18:55:59.000Z"},{"title":"Support directional remotes in your tvOS app","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=33cpm46r","pubDate":"Mon, 10 May 2021 05:00:49 PDT","content":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/BF1B405F-794E-4F37-9264-825D65A27B3A/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"A hand on a video game controller\"></div><p>In addition to the Siri Remote, tvOS provides support for a variety of hardware and software remotes with touch or button interfaces.

Each subsequent press of that button will increase the seek rate. Once someone passes the last seek rate, the player returns to its normal playback rate. If the opposite button is pressed while seeking, it decreases the seek rate; each subsequent press will do the same until the player returns to its normal playback rate. </p>\n<p>You can support these controls in your app with <code>changePlaybackRateCommand</code> in <code>MPRemoteCommandCenter</code>. You’ll also want to make sure to update your player rate with the <code>playbackRate</code> property of the <code>MPChangePlaybackRateCommandEvent</code>.</p>\n<p>If someone holds a dedicated fast forward or rewind button, <code>MPRemoteCommandCenter</code> will fire a <code>seekForwardCommand</code> or <code>seekBackwardCommand</code>. Your registered target will receive <code>MPSeekCommandEventType.beginSeeking</code>, and your app should set the player to the desired seek rate. Once someone releases the button, your app receives a new command event with the case <code>MPSeekCommandEventType.endSeeking</code>, telling it to return the player rate to normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Directional pad fast forward and rewind</strong>\nIf a person long presses the left or right directional pad buttons, your app should seek forward or backward respectively and update the seek rate. While seeking, a person can use a short press on the left or right directional pad buttons to update the seek rate as described in the previous section.</p>\n<p><strong>Adopt fast forward and rewind

You’ll need to use UITapGestureRecognizer and MPRemoteCommandCenter to handle these interactions in your custom player.// Gesture to handle play pause state\nlet playPauseGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(togglePlaybackState)\nplayPauseGesture.allowedPressTypes = [.playPause, .select]\nview.addGestureRecognizer(playPauseGesture)\n\n// MPRemoteCommands to handle play pause state\nlet remoteCommandCenter = MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()\nremoteCommandCenter.playCommand.addTarget(self, action: #selector(playHandler))\nremoteCommandCenter.pauseCommand.addTarget(self, action: #selector(pauseHandler))Skip forward and skip backward\nWhen using a directional remote, people can skip through video in the appropriate direction by pressing left or right on the directional pad. Additionally, certain remotes have dedicated skip forward and skip backward buttons that can map to this functionality. To ensure someone can navigate forward and backward through your content, use UITapGestureRecognizer and MPRemoteCommandCenter to create the correct gestures.// Gesture to handle directional pad left\nlet dPadLeftGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(dPadLeftHandler))\ndPadLeftGesture.allowedPressTypes = [NSNumber(value: UIPress.PressType.leftArrow.rawValue)]\nview.addGestureRecognizer(dPadLeftGesture)\n\n// Gesture to handle directional pad right\nlet dPadRightGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(dPadRightHandler))\ndPadRightGesture.allowedPressTypes = [NSNumber(value: UIPress.PressType.rightArrow.rawValue)]\nview.addGestureRecognizer(dPadRightGesture)\n\n// MPRemoteCommands to handle skip forward and skip backward\nlet remoteCommandCenter = MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()\nremoteCommandCenter.skipForwardCommand.addTarget(self, action: #selector(skipForwardHandler))\nremoteCommandCenter.skipBackwardCommand.addTarget(self, action: #selector(skipBackwardHandler))Fast forward and rewind\nPeople can fast forward and rewind through content in different ways depending on the remote they use. Some remotes offer dedicated fast forward and rewind buttons, while others achieve this with a long press on the left or right directional pad buttons.Note: On tvOS, we recommend using the following UI labels to pair with the corresponding supported player rates.\nUI Labels to tvOS Playback Rates\n1x = 8.0\n2x = 24.0\n3x = 48.0\n4x = 96.0Dedicated fast forward and rewind buttons\nFor remotes with dedicated fast forward and rewind buttons, a short press will initiate a continuous seek forward or backward. Each subsequent press of that button will increase the seek rate. Once someone passes the last seek rate, the player returns to its normal playback rate. If the opposite button is pressed while seeking, it decreases the seek rate; each subsequent press will do the same until the player returns to its normal playback rate. \nYou can support these controls in your app with changePlaybackRateCommand in MPRemoteCommandCenter. You’ll also want to make sure to update your player rate with the playbackRate property of the MPChangePlaybackRateCommandEvent.\nIf someone holds a dedicated fast forward or rewind button, MPRemoteCommandCenter will fire a seekForwardCommand or seekBackwardCommand. Your registered target will receive MPSeekCommandEventType.beginSeeking, and your app should set the player to the desired seek rate. Once someone releases the button, your app receives a new command event with the case MPSeekCommandEventType.endSeeking, telling it to return the player rate to normal.\nDirectional pad fast forward and rewind\nIf a person long presses the left or right directional pad buttons, your app should seek forward or backward respectively and update the seek rate. While seeking, a person can use a short press on the left or right directional pad buttons to update the seek rate as described in the previous section.\nAdopt fast forward and rewind in your custom video player\nTo incorporate these gestures in your app for all remotes, you’ll want to use MPRemoteCommandCenter, UITapGestureRecognizer and UILongPressGestureRecognizer.// MPRemoteCommands to handle dedicated fast forward and rewind buttons\nlet remoteCommandCenter = MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()\n\n// MPRemoteCommands to handle dedicated fast forward and rewind (short presses)\nremoteCommandCenter.changePlaybackRateCommand.addTarget { [unowned self] event in\n    guard let event = event as? MPChangePlaybackRateCommandEvent else { return .commandFailed }\n    self.assetPlayer.player.rate = event.playbackRate\n    return .success\n}\n\n// MPRemoteCommands to handle dedicated fast forward button (long press)\nremoteCommandCenter.seekForwardCommand.addTarget { [unowned self] event in\n    guard let event = event as? MPSeekCommandEvent else { return .commandFailed }\n    if event.type == .beginSeeking {\n        self.assetPlayer.player.rate = 24.0\n    }\n    if event.type == .endSeeking {\n        self.assetPlayer.player.rate = 1.0\n    }\n    return .success\n}\n\n// MPRemoteCommands to handle dedicated rewind button (long press)\nremoteCommandCenter.seekBackwardCommand.addTarget { [unowned self] event in\n    guard let event = event as? MPSeekCommandEvent else { return .commandFailed }\n    if event.type == .beginSeeking {\n        self.assetPlayer.player.rate = -24.0\n    }\n    if event.type == .endSeeking {\n        self.assetPlayer.player.rate = 1.0\n    }\n    return .success\n}\n\n        \n// Gestures to handle fast forward and rewind from directional pad\n\n// Gesture to handle dpad right (long press)\nlet dPadRightLong = UILongPressGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(dPadRightLongHandler))\ndPadRightLong.allowedPressTypes = [NSNumber(value: UIPress.PressType.rightArrow.rawValue)]\nview.addGestureRecognizer(dPadRightLong)\n\n// Gesture to handle dpad left (long press)\nlet dPadLeftLong = UILongPressGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(dPadLeftLongHandler))\ndPadLeftLong.allowedPressTypes = [NSNumber(value: UIPress.PressType.leftArrow.rawValue)]\nview.addGestureRecognizer(dPadLeftLong)\n\n// Gesture to handle dpad right (short press)\nlet dPadRightGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(dPadRightHandler))\ndPadRightGesture.allowedPressTypes = [NSNumber(value: UIPress.PressType.rightArrow.rawValue)]\nview.addGestureRecognizer(dPadRightGesture)\n\n// Gesture to handle dpad left (short press)\nlet dPadLeftGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(dPadLeftHandler))\ndPadLeftGesture.allowedPressTypes = [NSNumber(value: UIPress.PressType.leftArrow.rawValue)]\nview.addGestureRecognizer(dPadLeftGesture)Support additional interactions in a custom playerPeople expect up or down swipes or presses to provide a consistent experience during video playback, like showing the player controls and transport bar on a press or swipe up, or showing the information panel on a swipe or press down.\nTransport Bar\nPeople should be able to see how much time remains on a piece of content. Swiping up or pressing up on a directional pad should show the player’s transport bar without stopping or pausing the player.// Gesture to handle directional pad up\nlet upGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: .upGestureRecognizer)\nupGesture.allowedPressTypes = [.upArrow]\nview.addGestureRecognizer(upGesture)Information Panel\nPeople should be able to access subtitle and audio selections along with other options while viewing content. Swiping down or pressing down on a directional pad should show these options without stopping or pausing the player.// Gesture to handle directional pad down\nlet downGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: .downGestureRecognizer)\ndownGesture.allowedPressTypes = [.downArrow]\nview.addGestureRecognizer(downGesture)Putting Your Users In Control\nNo matter which interaction method someone chooses to use with Apple TV, you can ensure they remain in control by offering a great experience in your app for all remotes. It’s easy when you use system frameworks like AVFoundation and AVKit and support custom gestures and media interactions with UITapGestureRecognizer and MPRemoteCommandCenter. And when you do, it lets people enjoy your content without worrying how to interact with your app.","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=33cpm46r","isoDate":"2021-05-10T12:00:49.000Z"},{"title":"Apple Search Ads introduces a new way to promote apps","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=p5kjwfnf","pubDate":"Tue, 04 May 2021 09:17:47 PDT","content":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/BF163FEF-6A94-4EB0-8E22-DFECFD5908B7/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"Two side-by-side iPhones display ads on the Search tab.

Use <code>eligibleForHDRPlayback</code> on <code>AVPlayer</code> to check for HDR playback support on the current device. In general, the classes <code>AVPlayer</code>, <code>AVPlayerlayer</code>, or <code>AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer</code> can be used to play Dolby Vision video. If your app uses <code>AVPlayer</code>, you don’t need to add anything additional to your code: The <code>AVFoundation</code> framework automatically sets up an HDR playback pipeline to handle Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 if it detects an asset in Dolby Vision and the device supports HDR playback.</p>\n<p>If your app uses<code>AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer</code> to render video, make sure any sample buffers passed to the sample buffer display layer are in formats suitable for HDR and carry Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 per-frame metadata. These sample buffers need to have 10-bit or higher bit-depth. A commonly used 10-bit format is 4:2:0 Y’CbCr video range, represented by <code>kCVPixelFormatType_420YpCbCr10BiPlanarVideoRange</code>. The associated <code>OSType</code> for this pixel format is <code>’x420’</code>.</p>\n<p>If your sample buffers are decoded using <code>VTDecompressionSession</code>, you can carry the Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 per-frame metadata in the buffers by using <code>kVTDecompressionPropertyKey_PropagatePerFrameHDRDisplayMetadata</code>. This value is true by default.</p>\n<p><strong>Asset inspection</strong>\n<code>AVMediaCharacteristic</code> provides options for specifying media type characteristics, including whether a video includes HDR metadata. You can use the Swift media characteristic <code>containsHDRVideo</code> to identify whether any segment of a track contains HDR so that your app can render it correctly. In Objective-C, you can use <code>AVMediaCharacteristicContainsHDRVideo</code>, defined in <code>AVMediaFormat.h</code>. </p>\n<p>After loading the tracks property using the Swift method <code>loadValuesAsynchronously(forKeys:completionHandler:)</code>, you can get HDR tracks using <code>tracks(withMediaCharacteristic:)</code>. Here’s how you might get all desired HDR tracks:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">let</span> hdrTracks <span class=\"syntax-operator\">=</span> asset.tracks(withMediaCharacteristic: .containsHDRVideo)</code></pre><p>In a similar fashion, you can use the Objective-C method <code>loadValuesAsynchronouslyForKeys:completionHandler:</code> to load the tracks property and obtain the HDR tracks with the method <code>tracksWithMediaCharacteristic:</code>, like so:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-built_in\">NSArray</span>&lt;<span class=\"syntax-built_in\">AVAssetTrack</span> *&gt; *hdrTracks \n= [asset tracksWithMediaCharacteristic:<span class=\"syntax-built_in\">AVMediaCharacteristicContainsHDRVideo</span>];</code></pre><p>The <code>hasMediaCharacteristic(_:)</code> method can be used to track media characteristics, such as HDR media type, format descriptions, or explicit tagging. For example:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">if</span> track.hasMediaCharacteristic(.containsHDRVideo){\n<span class=\"syntax-comment\">// Process HDR track</span>\n}</code></pre><p>In Objective-C, you can use the same <code>hasMediaCharacteristic:</code> method for explicit tagging, as demonstrated here:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">if</span>([track hasMediaCharacteristic:<span class=\"syntax-built_in\">AVMediaCharacteristicContainsHDRVideo</span>]){\n    <span class=\"syntax-comment\">// Process HDR track</span>\n}</code></pre><h3>Support HDR video editing and previewing in your app</h3><p>To add HDR content editing to your application, use <code>AVVideoComposition</code>. If you’re using the built-in compositor, you can also use the Swift initializer <code>init(asset:applyingCIFiltersWithHandler:)</code> or the Objective-C initializer <code>videoCompositionWithAsset:applyingCIFiltersWithHandler:</code> with built-in <code>CIFilters</code> to easily incorporate an HDR editing pipeline in your app.</p>\n<p>Custom compositors can support HDR content, too: You can use the <code>supportsHDRSourceFrames</code> property to indicate HDR capability. For Objective-C, the <code>supportsHDRSourceFrames</code> property is a part of the <code>AVVideoCompositing</code> protocol defined in <code>AVVideoCompositing.h</code>.</p>\n<p>If your custom compositor needs to operate in 10-bit HDR pixel formats, you’ll need to select pixel buffer attributes that your compositor can accept as input by using the <code>sourcePixelBufferAttributes</code> property. For Objective-C, this property is found in <code>AVVideoCompositing.h</code>. The value of this property is a dictionary which contains pixel buffer attribute keys defined in <code>CoreVideo</code> header file <code>CVPixelBuffer.h</code>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, to create new buffers for processing, you’ll need the correct pixel buffer attributes required by the video compositor. For this particular purpose, use the property <code>requiredPixelBufferAttributesForRenderContext</code>.</p>\n<p>If your app offers video previewing during editing, modifying the pixel values may invalidate the video’s existing dynamic metadata and its usage. Because the Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 metadata is completely transparent, you can use <code>AVPlayerItem</code> to drop any invalid metadata during preview-only scenarios, as well as update dynamic metadata during export to reflect changes in the video content. </p>\n<p>To configure HDR settings, you can use the <code>appliesPerFrameHDRDisplayMetadata</code> property from <code>AVPlayerItem</code> , which defaults to true.

This format is designed to be backwards compatible with HLG, allowing existing HEVC decoders to decode as HLG. Video is recorded by the Camera app as a QuickTime File Format (QTFF) movie (.mov extension). Signaling for Dolby Vision in a QTFF movie is similar to signaling in Dolby Vision Streams within the ISO base media file format.Learn more about Dolby Vision ProfilesLearn more about Dolby Vision LevelsLearn more about Dolby Vision StreamsSupport HDR video playback in your appBoth iOS and macOS support HDR video playback on all eligible devices. Use eligibleForHDRPlayback on AVPlayer to check for HDR playback support on the current device. In general, the classes AVPlayer, AVPlayerlayer, or AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer can be used to play Dolby Vision video. If your app uses AVPlayer, you don’t need to add anything additional to your code: The AVFoundation framework automatically sets up an HDR playback pipeline to handle Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 if it detects an asset in Dolby Vision and the device supports HDR playback.\nIf your app usesAVSampleBufferDisplayLayer to render video, make sure any sample buffers passed to the sample buffer display layer are in formats suitable for HDR and carry Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 per-frame metadata. These sample buffers need to have 10-bit or higher bit-depth. A commonly used 10-bit format is 4:2:0 Y’CbCr video range, represented by kCVPixelFormatType_420YpCbCr10BiPlanarVideoRange. The associated OSType for this pixel format is ’x420’.\nIf your sample buffers are decoded using VTDecompressionSession, you can carry the Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 per-frame metadata in the buffers by using kVTDecompressionPropertyKey_PropagatePerFrameHDRDisplayMetadata. This value is true by default.\nAsset inspection\nAVMediaCharacteristic provides options for specifying media type characteristics, including whether a video includes HDR metadata. You can use the Swift media characteristic containsHDRVideo to identify whether any segment of a track contains HDR so that your app can render it correctly. In Objective-C, you can use AVMediaCharacteristicContainsHDRVideo, defined in AVMediaFormat.h. \nAfter loading the tracks property using the Swift method loadValuesAsynchronously(forKeys:completionHandler:), you can get HDR tracks using tracks(withMediaCharacteristic:). Here’s how you might get all desired HDR tracks:let hdrTracks = asset.tracks(withMediaCharacteristic: .containsHDRVideo)In a similar fashion, you can use the Objective-C method loadValuesAsynchronouslyForKeys:completionHandler: to load the tracks property and obtain the HDR tracks with the method tracksWithMediaCharacteristic:, like so:NSArray<AVAssetTrack *> *hdrTracks \n= [asset tracksWithMediaCharacteristic:AVMediaCharacteristicContainsHDRVideo];The hasMediaCharacteristic(_:) method can be used to track media characteristics, such as HDR media type, format descriptions, or explicit tagging. For example:if track.hasMediaCharacteristic(.containsHDRVideo){\n// Process HDR track\n}In Objective-C, you can use the same hasMediaCharacteristic: method for explicit tagging, as demonstrated here:if([track hasMediaCharacteristic:AVMediaCharacteristicContainsHDRVideo]){\n    // Process HDR track\n}Support HDR video editing and previewing in your appTo add HDR content editing to your application, use AVVideoComposition. If you’re using the built-in compositor, you can also use the Swift initializer init(asset:applyingCIFiltersWithHandler:) or the Objective-C initializer videoCompositionWithAsset:applyingCIFiltersWithHandler: with built-in CIFilters to easily incorporate an HDR editing pipeline in your app.\nCustom compositors can support HDR content, too: You can use the supportsHDRSourceFrames property to indicate HDR capability. For Objective-C, the supportsHDRSourceFrames property is a part of the AVVideoCompositing protocol defined in AVVideoCompositing.h.\nIf your custom compositor needs to operate in 10-bit HDR pixel formats, you’ll need to select pixel buffer attributes that your compositor can accept as input by using the sourcePixelBufferAttributes property. For Objective-C, this property is found in AVVideoCompositing.h. The value of this property is a dictionary which contains pixel buffer attribute keys defined in CoreVideo header file CVPixelBuffer.h.\nAdditionally, to create new buffers for processing, you’ll need the correct pixel buffer attributes required by the video compositor. For this particular purpose, use the property requiredPixelBufferAttributesForRenderContext.\nIf your app offers video previewing during editing, modifying the pixel values may invalidate the video’s existing dynamic metadata and its usage. Because the Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 metadata is completely transparent, you can use AVPlayerItem to drop any invalid metadata during preview-only scenarios, as well as update dynamic metadata during export to reflect changes in the video content. \nTo configure HDR settings, you can use the appliesPerFrameHDRDisplayMetadata property from AVPlayerItem , which defaults to true. In Objective-C, the property defaults to YES and can be found in AVPlayerItem.h.\nBy default, AVFoundation will attempt to use Dolby Vision metadata if present for a video, but you can tell your app to ignore it: Just set the appliesPerFrameHDRDisplayMetadata property from AVPlayerItem to false in Swift, or NO in Objective-C. If your application is using VTDecompressionSession APIs from VideoToolbox, you can turn off Dolby Vision tone mapping with kVTDecompressionPropertyKey_PropagatePerFrameHDRDisplayMetadata. To use this property in C or Objective-C, make sure to include VideoToolbox in the framework header VTDecompressionProperties.h.Support HDR export in your appYou can support HDR video export in your app when you work with AVAssetWriter and HEVC presets.\nDiscover presets and AVAssetExportSession\nAll HEVC presets have been upgraded to support HDR. The output format will match the source format, so if the source file is Dolby Vision Profile 8.4, the exported movie will also be Dolby Vision Profile 8.4. If you need to change the output format, you can use AVAssetWriter.Note: H.264 presets will convert HDR to Standard Dynamic Range (SDR).In order to preserve Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 during export using AVAssetWriter, you must choose a suitable output format, color properties that support Dolby Vision, and a 10-bit profile level. \nTo start, note that querying supportedOutputSettingsKeys(for:) in Swift or supportedOutputSettingsKeysForConnection: in Objective-C provides a list of output settings keys supported for the current device. \nFor Dolby Vision export, the video output settings dictionary key AVVideoCompressionPropertiesKey allows you to control bit rate, B-frame delivery, I-frame interval, and codec quality. The value associated with this key is an instance of NSDictionary. For Objective-C, this key is found in AVVideoSettings.h.\nFor example, a video output settings dictionary for Dolby Vision in Swift would contain these key/value pairs:let videoOutputSettings: [String: Any] = [\n    AVVideoCodecKey: AVVideoCodecType.hevc,\n    AVVideoProfileLevelKey: kVTProfileLevel_HEVC_Main10_AutoLevel,\n    AVVideoColorPropertiesKey: [\n        AVVideoColorPrimariesKey: AVVideoColorPrimaries_ITU_R_2020,\n        AVVideoTransferFunctionKey: AVVideoTransferFunction_ITU_R_2100_HLG,\n        AVVideoYCbCrMatrixKey: AVVideoYCbCrMatrix_ITU_R_2020\n    ],\n    AVVideoCompressionPropertiesKey: [\n        kVTCompressionPropertyKey_HDRMetadataInsertionMode: kVTHDRMetadataInsertionMode_Auto\n    ]\n]With Objective-C, your video output settings dictionary would contain the same key/value pairs:NSDictionary<NSString*, id>* videoOutputSettings = @{\n    AVVideoCodecKey: AVVideoCodecTypeHEVC,\n    AVVideoProfileLevelKey: (__bridge NSString*)kVTProfileLevel_HEVC_Main10_AutoLevel,\n    AVVideoColorPropertiesKey: @{\n        AVVideoColorPrimariesKey: AVVideoColorPrimaries_ITU_R_2020,\n        AVVideoTransferFunctionKey: AVVideoTransferFunction_ITU_R_2100_HLG,\n        AVVideoYCbCrMatrixKey: AVVideoYCbCrMatrix_ITU_R_2020\n    },\n    AVVideoCompressionPropertiesKey: @{\n        (__bridge NSString*)kVTCompressionPropertyKey_HDRMetadataInsertionMode: (__bridge NSString*)kVTHDRMetadataInsertionMode_Auto\n    }\n};In Objective-C, the key kVTCompressionPropertyKey_HDRMetadataInsertionMode and the value kVTHDRMetadataInsertionMode_Auto are found in VTDecompressionProperties.h.\nIn addition to defining key/value pairs, make sure that the pixel buffers presented to AVAssetWriterInput are a 10-bit 4:2:0 Y’CbCr video range represented by 'x420' OSType.\nYou may elect to use a separate AVAssetReader or  AVAssetWriter model for export. In that case, you can use the VideoToolbox property kVTCompressionPropertyKey_PreserveDynamicHDRMetadata and set it to kCFBooleanFalse or false for C/Objective-C or Swift respectively.

This requirement now goes into effect starting with the upcoming beta update, and will roll out to everyone in early spring with an upcoming release of iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and tvOS 14. We encourage you to verify your app’s implementation of AppTrackingTransparency as soon as possible. Without the user’s permission, you will not be allowed to track them and the device’s advertising identifier value will be all zeros.\nIn an upcoming release of iOS and iPadOS, we will enhance SKAdNetwork and add Private Click Measurement support for apps, allowing advertising networks to better attribute advertisements that display within apps on these platforms.

Assuming the following PEM-encoded public-key certificate, stored in file ca.pem, you can calculate its SPKI-SHA256-BASE64 value with the openssl command.-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----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\nCAUw7C29C79Fv1C5qfPrmAESrciIxpg0X40KPMbp1ZWVbd4=\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\n$ cat ca.pem | openssl x509 -inform pem -noout -outform pem -pubkey | openssl pkey -pubin -inform pem -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64To introduce redundancy into your pinning configuration, you can associate multiple public keys with a domain name. <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>NSPinnedDomains</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>example.org</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>\n            <true/>\n            <key>NSPinnedCAIdentities</key>\n            <array>\n                <dict>\n                    <key>SPKI-SHA256-BASE64</key>\n                    <string>r/mIkG3eEpVdm+u/ko/cwxzOMo1bk4TyHIlByibiA5E=</string>\n                </dict>\n            </array>\n        </dict>\n        <key>example.net</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>NSPinnedLeafIdentities</key>\n            <array>\n                <dict>\n                    <key>SPKI-SHA256-BASE64</key>\n                    <string>i9HaIScvf6T/skE3/A7QOq5n5cTYs8UHNOEFCnkguSI=</string>\n                </dict>\n                <dict>\n                    <key>SPKI-SHA256-BASE64</key>\n                    <string>i9HaIScvf6T/skE3/A7QOq5n5cTYs8UHNOEFCnkguSI=</string>\n                </dict>\n            </array>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n</dict>For example, to pin multiple public keys for the example.net server certificate, you would add individual entries as items in an array to the Info.plist file of your app. To satisfy the pinning requirement for a connection to example.net, the server certificate must include one of those keys.ResourcesNSAppTransportSecurity","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g9ejcf8y","isoDate":"2021-01-15T00:29:31.000Z"},{"title":"Meet App Clip Codes","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g9qbtdvu","pubDate":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 09:00:14 PST","content":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4367279B-E1C6-44AF-B86E-E0142DCECE66/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"App Clips icon on blue background\"></div><p>App Clip Codes are customizable Apple-designed markers built to launch your App Clip.

We’ll show you how to design a great icon, integrate it into your Xcode project, and assign document types and type identifiers.</p><h3>Design a document icon for your app</h3><p>By default, if you don’t specify a document icon for a file type in your app, macOS will automatically create one for you by compositing your app’s icon together with the correct extension name.

These icons may be displayed on screen as small as 16pt or large enough to showcase every glorious design detail. \nDepending on the file type and personal preference, document icons can also display document previews. If someone has chosen not to show document extensions in System Preferences, these icons can additionally provide additional context in deciphering their file type and native program.\nWith macOS Big Sur, you can customize and control how your app’s document icons display across the system. We’ll show you how to design a great icon, integrate it into your Xcode project, and assign document types and type identifiers.Design a document icon for your appBy default, if you don’t specify a document icon for a file type in your app, macOS will automatically create one for you by compositing your app’s icon together with the correct extension name. This is a common pattern for imported document types or non-proprietary file formats that your application can open such as MP3, JPG or PNG. Both the Music and Preview apps use system-generated document icons for document types like JPG and MP3.You can additionally create a custom document icon if your app supports multiple file types and you’d like to visually distinguish between them. For example, a drawing application may open a jpg file, a project file, a library of drawing components, a plugin or a color swatch. \nWhen creating a custom icon, we recommend keeping its design simple. Try to depict what your icon represents as closely as possible and with as few details as possible. Additionally, think of other document types that your document may commonly be next to, and use distinct shapes and colors that are identifiable even at smaller sizes. \nIf you plan to create multiple custom icons for different file types, it’s important to make each design distinct and understandable to help people know what to expect when they open them.The elements of a custom document icon\nBeginning with macOS Big Sur, you can generate a new custom document icon with a set of images and a text string.Breaking down document icon compositionTo create a new custom document icon, you can provide a background fill, center image, or text string. Each of these three elements is optional, allowing you to use just one element or any combination of the three to customize your icon. From there, macOS will automatically layer, position, and mask these elements, then composite them into a page icon with a right corner fold.You can download Sketch and Photoshop templates on Apple Design Resources to assist in the generation of the image assets in all their required sizes. Apple Design ResourcesFill in the background\nThe background image allows you to customize the background of your icon. The art should fill the entire drawing area, as shown below, and the system will automatically mask it to the document shape in all sizes.Document icon backgroundBackground images can not only be used to change the background of your document, but you can also use them to create custom designs that fill the entire page.The background image should be drawn in the following sizes:\n\n512x512\n512x512@2x\n256x256\n256x256@2x\n128x128\n128x128@2x\n32x32\n32x32@2x\n16x16\n16x16@2x\nThe Xcode Project icon and the Rich Text Format icons use nothing but the background fill element to create a custom look and feel.Add a center image\nThe center image is always half the size of the document canvas. For example, the center image displays at 16pt on a 32pt icon size.\nThe bulk of the artwork for the center image should be drawn at ~80% of the canvas size. For example, on the 256x256 version, the drawing should be inside a 205x205 area, as shown in the image below.

When ready, you can then run the following command in the Terminal app:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code>xcrun safari-web-extension-converter /path/to/my/extension/</code></pre><p>The converter tool will search for your extension’s manifest at <code>./path/to/my/extension/manifest.json</code> and generate a default configuration for your Xcode project. If the configuration appears correct, type <code>yes</code> at the prompt and press the <strong>Return</strong> key. If not, type <code>no</code> and you can enter the converter tool’s interactive mode to customize the configuration.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Note: Verify your keys</strong></em>\n<em>During the conversion process, <code>safari-web-extension-converter</code> will look through your manifest for any keys that aren’t supported by your installed version of Safari. If Xcode finds any issues, the app will display a warning message. If you receive this, consider whether the affected keys are critical for your extension to function. You may still be able to leave these keys in place and have everything run smoothly, but be sure to test your extension to confirm.</em></p><hr><h3>Adjust a converted extension in Xcode</h3><p>Safari Web Extensions require a container app so that you can easily distribute your extension on the Mac App Store. As part of the conversion process, Xcode automatically creates and opens a container app project that contains your extension files. From here, you can test your extension, make any necessary code changes, update your extension’s icon, and upload your container app for distribution through the Mac App Store.</p><p><strong>Test, test, and test again</strong>\nWhile inside your Xcode project, you can build and run your extension by either pressing <strong>Command-R</strong> or the <strong>Play</strong> button in the upper left portion of the screen. </p>\n<p>Your container app has a button to open Safari Extensions preferences. Select this button to open Safari and enable your extension in the browser.</p>\n<p>Note: If this is your first time testing an extension through Xcode, you’ll need to enable support for unsigned extensions in Safari. To do so, follow these steps:</p><ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Safari</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Safari &gt; Preferences</strong>.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Check the <strong>”Show Develop menu in menu bar”</strong> checkbox.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the Develop menu and select <strong>”Allow Unsigned Extensions.”</strong> You may have to enter your admin password to make changes.</li>\n</ol><p><strong>Make any code changes</strong>\nBy default, your Xcode project references your extension’s existing content as well as native Swift or Objective-C code to create the container app. After testing, you can make any needed changes to this project; any alterations you make will automatically show up as part of your Safari Web Extension the next time you build your Xcode project.</p><p><strong>Update your icon</strong>\nXcode will use any extension icons listed in your manifest as your app icon, which will also display on your Mac App Store listing.

When ready, you can then run the following command in the Terminal app:xcrun safari-web-extension-converter /path/to/my/extension/The converter tool will search for your extension’s manifest at ./path/to/my/extension/manifest.json and generate a default configuration for your Xcode project. If the configuration appears correct, type yes at the prompt and press the Return key. If not, type no and you can enter the converter tool’s interactive mode to customize the configuration.Note: Verify your keys\nDuring the conversion process, safari-web-extension-converter will look through your manifest for any keys that aren’t supported by your installed version of Safari. If Xcode finds any issues, the app will display a warning message. If you receive this, consider whether the affected keys are critical for your extension to function. You may still be able to leave these keys in place and have everything run smoothly, but be sure to test your extension to confirm.Adjust a converted extension in XcodeSafari Web Extensions require a container app so that you can easily distribute your extension on the Mac App Store. As part of the conversion process, Xcode automatically creates and opens a container app project that contains your extension files. From here, you can test your extension, make any necessary code changes, update your extension’s icon, and upload your container app for distribution through the Mac App Store.Test, test, and test again\nWhile inside your Xcode project, you can build and run your extension by either pressing Command-R or the Play button in the upper left portion of the screen. \nYour container app has a button to open Safari Extensions preferences. Select this button to open Safari and enable your extension in the browser.\nNote: If this is your first time testing an extension through Xcode, you’ll need to enable support for unsigned extensions in Safari. To do so, follow these steps:\nOpen Safari.\nSelect Safari > Preferences.\nNavigate to the Advanced tab.\nCheck the ”Show Develop menu in menu bar” checkbox.\nNavigate to the Develop menu and select ”Allow Unsigned Extensions.” You may have to enter your admin password to make changes.\nMake any code changes\nBy default, your Xcode project references your extension’s existing content as well as native Swift or Objective-C code to create the container app. After testing, you can make any needed changes to this project; any alterations you make will automatically show up as part of your Safari Web Extension the next time you build your Xcode project.Update your icon\nXcode will use any extension icons listed in your manifest as your app icon, which will also display on your Mac App Store listing. Because Safari Web Extension icons are typically smaller, however, you may want to update to a higher-resolution version of this image for the best look. icon upload in Xcode screenshotTo change your icons, select the Assets.xcassets folder in the Xcode sidebar, then drag the new icons into the appropriately-sized image wells.Add any additional files to your Xcode project\nIf you need to add additional resources or code files to your extension after conversion — for example, images used by your user interface or other dependencies missed during conversion — you will also need to manually include these files in your Xcode project.To do so, select any additional files in Finder and drag them into the Resources folder within your Xcode project, located in the left sidebar. Uncheck ’Copy items if needed’ in the file dialog to make sure these files automatically associate with your app.Distribute your extensionWhen you’re ready to share your extension, sign in with your Apple Developer account to App Store Connect and upload the container app to for distribution.

URLs with fewer characters, path, and query components have a better chance to fit into an App Clip Code.</p>\n<p>We recommend using a short host name with as few subdomains as possible, as well as removing the <em>www</em> subdomain whenever possible. You’ll also want to omit a trailing ‘/’ character from the end of the URL if possible. For instance, <code>https://www.example.com/</code> can be changed to <code>https://example.com</code>.</p>\n<p>If you do plan to use a subdomain, consider using <code>appclip</code> to define App Clip-specific URLs for App Clip Codes. This special subdomain is compressed efficiently and it allows URLs to have short path and query components by eliminating the possibility of a conflict with an unrelated functionality of your website. </p>\n<p>While adding this subdomain is optional, if you do opt to use it, it must appear as the first subdomain of the URL’s host, like so: <code>https://appclip.example.com</code>.</p><p><strong>Optimize for compression</strong>\nConsider using the minimum number of characters needed to uniquely identify a resource in your URLs, as long UUIDs will lower the effectiveness of the compression.</p>\n<p>In addition, replace long query string argument names and values with short names and values to aid in compression. For example, you can turn argument names into shorter names and values into an enum, like so: <code>https://example.com/?status=view</code> could be restructured as <code>https://example.com/?p=0</code>.</p>\n<p>Using decimal numbers as query parameter values may also lead to better compression of the URL.</p><p><strong>Choose your words carefully</strong>\nApp Clip Codes offer more effective URL encoding for certain words in the URL path component, like <code>account</code>, <code>app</code>, <code>download</code>, <code>shop</code>, <code>upload</code>, <code>visit</code>, and more.

For example, you might distribute code redemption URLs in digital marketing channels such as your email distribution lists or text messages. You might share printed offer codes at events or even alongside the purchase of a physical product. </p>\n<p>When distributing offer codes, make sure to note any eligibility or availability limits, as well as the code’s expiration date.

For example, you can:\n\nSend an email sharing the latest features, recently added content, and an offer code to current or lapsed subscribers so they can experience your service for a limited time.\nDistribute flyers that include unique offer codes  to promote your service to event attendees.\nPartner with another company on a marketing initiative or campaign to help promote your app.\nProvide an offer code to a subscriber with a customer service issue to compensate for the issue and encourage retention.\nDistribute offer codes within an app that you are sunsetting as a way to transition subscribers to your new app and promote your service.\n\nYou can provide multiple types of offers to people depending on your business goals. To determine which type might be best for a particular use case, consider each offer’s intended use, customer eligibility, redemption limits, and other criteria.Learn more about providing subscription offersConfigure and create offer codesYou can create new offer codes within App Store Connect. When you set up a new code, you’ll also need to determine customer eligibility: Is this for a new, existing, or expired subscriber? \nIf creating a code for a new subscriber, you’ll also want to decide whether the code is valid in addition to any introductory offers you may provide within your app.\nAs with other subscription offers in your app, you can choose whether the offer is free, pay as you go, or pay up front. You can configure offer codes in App Store Connect. In the offer codes section, you can see your active and inactive offers, as well as the number of codes you have available to create. After you’ve configured your offer, you can create and download codes. You can create up to 150,000 new codes every quarter per app. \nNote: Codes expire a maximum of six months from their creation date, so be mindful of how many codes you create at a given time to ensure you have enough valid codes to last the duration of your campaign.\nOnce you’ve downloaded your codes, you can use the URL in App Store Connect and create associated one-time code redemption URLs. You’ll need to copy the URL from your offer details page, then add the specific code to the end of the URL, like so:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/redeem?id=YourAppAppleID&code=OfferCode\nCustomers can redeem only one code per active offer, but may be eligible to redeem multiple different offer codes for a single subscription, depending on your configuration choices.\nBefore creating any offer codes, be sure to set up your server to validate receipts so you can properly entitle service. You can also enable App Store server notifications to understand subscription updates and status changes in real-time. Learn more about setting up offer codesDistribute offer codesYou can distribute offer codes however you choose. Consider which channels might be most effective at reaching your intended customers. For example, you might distribute code redemption URLs in digital marketing channels such as your email distribution lists or text messages. You might share printed offer codes at events or even alongside the purchase of a physical product. \nWhen distributing offer codes, make sure to note any eligibility or availability limits, as well as the code’s expiration date. If sharing offer codes with existing customers, make sure the offer is for a subscription within the same subscription group as their existing subscription.Learn more about subscription groupsRedeem offer codesIn order for customers to redeem an offer code, your app must be in the Ready for Sale state in App Store Connect. Customers on iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 and later can redeem offer codes by entering them in the “Redeem Gift Card or Code” page in their App Store account settings, or directly within your app if you’ve implemented the presentCodeRedemptionSheet API. Additionally, if you’ve created and shared one-time code redemption URLs, customers can redeem offer codes using that link.presentCodeRedemptionSheet()Apple handles the redemption experience, which includes an offer details screen with the app icon, subscription display name, duration, and pricing; if you’ve previously added a promotional in-app purchase image for the subscription, this is shown instead of your app icon.\nYou can customize each of these details within App Store Connect. To help people make an informed decision, make sure that they clearly describe your subscription. If a customer attempts to redeem your code but does not have your app installed, they’ll be able to download it during the redemption experience.After tapping a custom redeem button within your app, the system automatically provides a series of code-redemption screens like the ones shown. If using one-time code redemption URLs, customers won’t need to enter the code as part of the redemption process.If you choose to support in-app redemption, consider adding a way to enter an offer code during relevant moments in the user experience — for example, adding a “Redeem Code” link on your subscription’s paywall screen, or in your app’s settings screen.\nOnce a user redeems an offer, provide a relevant experience based on their subscription state. For example, for a first-time subscriber, you might highlight the benefits of your subscription and provide onboarding. If your app includes account creation or requires agreement to additional terms, make this process as smooth as possible for customers who redeemed a code and are new to your app.ResourcesLearn more about providing subscription offersLearn more about designing subscriptionsImplementing Offer Codes in Your App","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=dopmcbjk","isoDate":"2020-11-19T16:45:12.000Z"},{"title":"Announcing the App Store Small Business Program","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=i7jzeefs","pubDate":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 06:46:05 PST","content":"<p>We believe that small businesses are the backbone of our global economy and the beating heart of innovation and opportunity in communities around the world.

The library removes the need to reimagine, resize, and reinvent graphic assets, providing a flexible range of weights and scales and automatic vertical alignment when adapting interfaces to different screen sizes.Find the right symbolWith more than 2,400 symbols — each available in nine weights and three scales — SF Symbols offers a large variety of options to suit your needs. You can easily browse or quickly search for and copy any of the vector-based icons from the SF Symbols app and paste them inside popular apps like Sketch, Adobe XD, or Figma, where they automatically align with text.Use the SF Symbols app to browse and preview selections before placing them in your project. Many symbols exist in both outline and filled variants which can be used in different contexts. Outlined symbols feature similar characteristics to text, whereas filled symbols provide additional contrast and emphasis.Tip: When it comes to symbol styles, less is more. Try to stick with a single style to help unify your design within a particular component or context.Aim for symbols that achieve immediate recognition; go for design clarity over creativity. What message do you want that symbol to convey? Would someone new to your app be familiar with it? If not, is there a different symbol that is more in tune with what someone might expect from this icon?Design custom symbolsIf you need to create a custom symbol for your app, the SF Symbols app can help you get started. Search for a symbol that’s similar to what you want to represent, then export it as customizable, vector-based template. \nUsing a vector editing tool like Illustrator or Sketch, make the changes you need while maintaining a consistent scale and weight to the symbol you’re modifying. Strive to create a symbol that is simple, recognizable, and clearly relates to the action or content it represents. Be mindful of how the SVG layer tree is named and organized; custom symbols must match the structure of the original file.Creating Custom Symbol Images for Your AppDesign with SF SymbolsWorking solo or in collaboration, designers and developers will appreciate the simplicity and adaptability of SF Symbols. You can use SF Symbols in apps running in iOS 13 and later, watchOS 6 and later, and tvOS 13 and later, and you’ll be able to use SF Symbols on macOS Big Sur this fall.Resources\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWDC19 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntroducing SF Symbols\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWDC20 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSF Symbols 2\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearn more about SF SymbolsIntroduction to Uniform Type IdentifiersDownload SF Symbols","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=0kzm2cc0","isoDate":"2020-10-29T14:00:41.000Z"},{"title":"Upcoming tax and price changes for apps and in-app purchases","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ul8i5to3","pubDate":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 12:39:59 PDT","content":"<p>When taxes or foreign exchange rates change, we sometimes need to update prices on the App Store.

By using this API, you can effectively embed the Safari interface — and many of its key features and privacy protections — into your app. The Apple Developer app displays web links through SFSafariViewController.SFSafariViewController is best used when you need to display interactive web experiences on websites you don’t own, or showcase parts of your web content that are generally outside the scope of your app.ResourcesWKWebViewSFSafariViewController\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWDC17 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat's New in Safari View Controller\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWDC17 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCustomized Loading in WKWebView","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=trjs0tcd","isoDate":"2020-10-08T16:00:20.000Z"},{"title":"New App Store marketing tools available","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g9mdaa8y","pubDate":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 16:23:38 PDT","content":"<p>Take advantage of new marketing resources to promote your apps around the world.

On iPhone, Security Code AutoFill makes it easy for people to quickly supply these codes by offering them in the QuickType bar. On a Mac running macOS Big Sur, Mac Catalyst and AppKit apps can take advantage of this feature as well. \nAdditionally, starting with iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur, we’re adding an extra layer of security to SMS-delivered codes by allowing you to associate codes with a specific web domain.How domain-bound codes workWhen you use a domain-bound code, AutoFill will suggest the code if — and only if — the domain is a match for the website or one of your app’s associated domains. For example, if you receive an SMS message that ends with @example.com #123456, AutoFill will offer to fill that code when they interact with example.com, any of its subdomains, or an app associated with example.com. If instead you receive an SMS message that ends with @example.net #123456, AutoFill will not offer the code on example.com or in example.com’s associated app. This makes it harder for an attacker to trick someone into entering one-time codes into a phishing site.SMS code displaying in Safari QuickType barWhile iOS and macOS will also display regular SMS-delivered codes in addition to domain-bound codes, we encourage everyone employing this authentication method to adopt this standard to provide a more secure experience for people on your website or app. If a message contains no domain information, it will continue to be offered in all relevant fields through AutoFill.How to set up SMS domain-bound codesYou can take advantage of domain-bound codes on both websites and apps with associated domains.Set up domain-bound codes for your website\nIn most cases, AutoFill should work automatically on Safari for iOS and macOS Big Sur, and requires no additional information from you.

Students from 60 different countries and regions brought their talents to the table, using the challenge’s three-minute limit to stretch their imaginations and explore Apple’s frameworks and technologies. The resulting 350 Swift Student Challenge winners have created AR experiences, projects powered by machine learning, educational material, virtual musical instruments, 8-bit games, and so much more. </p><h3>Swipe to unlock</h3><p>In 2019, after having studied just one month at the Apple Developer Academy in Porto Alegre, Brazil, Henrique Conte submitted his first Swift playground project. While he didn’t win a WWDC Scholarship that year, the experience drove him to continue exploring and refining his code.</p>\n<p>“This year I felt that, after reading and studying about so many different Apple frameworks, I should try to accomplish the WWDC19 main phrase: ‘Write code. Blow minds,’” he told us. And he did. His winning submission, a three-minute game designed for MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar, excels in both its technical acuity and creativity.</p>\n<p>Within the playground, players have to help Eleanor, a young developer, escape from a cave. The twist: The “cave” level is entirely located within the Touch Bar. “I chose to use unusual frameworks to show that it is possible to do amazing things with them,” Conte said. “I feel that [the Touch Bar] has so much potential yet to be discovered, and I wanted to demonstrate some of its capabilities.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/9224C2B2-8900-441B-97B7-2BCF27DD98F8/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"Henrique Conte’s winning submission, “ESCape, Eleanor!”\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Henrique Conte’s winning submission, “ESCape, Eleanor!”</p></div><p>Though he had never previously developed for macOS, Conte immediately took to the challenge. Like learning any new development concept, he ran into a few initial obstacles — “when I received the message “No such module 'UIKit’ [after trying to add it to my project] I noticed things would get interesting,” he joked — but he quickly picked up the fundamentals of Mac programming, using AppKit and SpriteKit to build a fully-interactive experience, including taps, slides, keyboard integrations, and multi-screen storytelling. He also paid close attention to the design, something that has become increasingly important to him.</p>\n<p>“I am definitely not a designer,” says Conte, “But in the past few years I noticed how essential it is to follow Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and to provide a great experience. There is no point in creating a perfect code if people will have trouble using your application!”</p>\n<p>You can find more of Conte’s work on the App Store: In the last year, he’s created four apps, including one to help children with autism communicate. He’s currently at work on his next project, which he’s building for both iOS and macOS, that addresses the problem of food waste.

Students from 60 different countries and regions brought their talents to the table, using the challenge’s three-minute limit to stretch their imaginations and explore Apple’s frameworks and technologies. The resulting 350 Swift Student Challenge winners have created AR experiences, projects powered by machine learning, educational material, virtual musical instruments, 8-bit games, and so much more. Swipe to unlockIn 2019, after having studied just one month at the Apple Developer Academy in Porto Alegre, Brazil, Henrique Conte submitted his first Swift playground project. While he didn’t win a WWDC Scholarship that year, the experience drove him to continue exploring and refining his code.\n“This year I felt that, after reading and studying about so many different Apple frameworks, I should try to accomplish the WWDC19 main phrase: ‘Write code. Blow minds,’” he told us. And he did. His winning submission, a three-minute game designed for MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar, excels in both its technical acuity and creativity.\nWithin the playground, players have to help Eleanor, a young developer, escape from a cave. The twist: The “cave” level is entirely located within the Touch Bar. “I chose to use unusual frameworks to show that it is possible to do amazing things with them,” Conte said. “I feel that [the Touch Bar] has so much potential yet to be discovered, and I wanted to demonstrate some of its capabilities.”Henrique Conte’s winning submission, “ESCape, Eleanor!”Though he had never previously developed for macOS, Conte immediately took to the challenge. Like learning any new development concept, he ran into a few initial obstacles — “when I received the message “No such module 'UIKit’ [after trying to add it to my project] I noticed things would get interesting,” he joked — but he quickly picked up the fundamentals of Mac programming, using AppKit and SpriteKit to build a fully-interactive experience, including taps, slides, keyboard integrations, and multi-screen storytelling. He also paid close attention to the design, something that has become increasingly important to him.\n“I am definitely not a designer,” says Conte, “But in the past few years I noticed how essential it is to follow Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and to provide a great experience. There is no point in creating a perfect code if people will have trouble using your application!”\nYou can find more of Conte’s work on the App Store: In the last year, he’s created four apps, including one to help children with autism communicate. He’s currently at work on his next project, which he’s building for both iOS and macOS, that addresses the problem of food waste. And — he’s happy to report — the macOS version will incorporate the Touch Bar.

Though some of those compositions are short by classical standards, Hearn is quick to highlight the years of artistry and care behind them. “It's someone’s life, you know?” he said. “I find that phenomenal.”\nDiscover the perfect soundtrack for your next programming project on Apple Music or wherever you like to listen, and know that you’re enjoying something uniquely human. “Music transcends our differences and has the power to unite us,” Viticci said. “To make us feel connected no matter what's going on in the world.” You can tune in to the full WWDC20 playlist collection on Apple Music.WWDC20 on Apple Music","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09pr41a8","isoDate":"2020-06-23T18:00:51.000Z"},{"title":"WWDC20 Daily Digest: Tuesday","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=cigjat1u","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 08:00:16 PDT","content":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/D7C5087B-1B34-4F0B-BAC9-E0234944A2C8/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"Three Memoji behind computers\"></div><p>Welcome back to day two of WWDC.

This is because not all cores are equal and so worker threads will not make identical progress. Instead, subdivide parallel problems into a large number of pieces and use a work-stealing algorithm to balance these pieces across threads to keep all workers busy.</p>\n<p><code>GCD</code> is the recommended API for expressing concurrent and parallel workloads in your application. Parallel workloads should use the <code>concurrentPerform</code> / <code>dispatch_apply</code> API to execute parallel instances of a block on multiple cores simultaneously. Set the number of iterations to at least three times the total number of cores on the system. This enables the work-stealing algorithm inside GCD to appropriately balance iterations.</p>\n<p>If you have an existing codebase that cannot adopt GCD and uses a custom pthread worker pool, you may benefit from implementing a work-stealing algorithm to achieve optimal performance.

You can use the following QoS classes on Apple platforms:For instance, you can use the QoS class Background to categorize all of your app’s background processes in order to maximize battery life.\nFor more details on Quality of Service, watch “Building Responsive and Efficient Apps with GCD” from WWDC15 and explore the energy efficiency guide. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWDC15 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuilding Responsive and Efficient Apps with GCD\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnergy efficiency guideManage parallel workloadsYour app can take advantage of both P and E cores to execute parallel worker threads and get tasks done faster and more efficiently. \nStatically pre-assigning pieces of a parallel workload to worker threads will leave threads idle before the end of the execution. This is because not all cores are equal and so worker threads will not make identical progress. Instead, subdivide parallel problems into a large number of pieces and use a work-stealing algorithm to balance these pieces across threads to keep all workers busy.\nGCD is the recommended API for expressing concurrent and parallel workloads in your application. Parallel workloads should use the concurrentPerform / dispatch_apply API to execute parallel instances of a block on multiple cores simultaneously. Set the number of iterations to at least three times the total number of cores on the system. This enables the work-stealing algorithm inside GCD to appropriately balance iterations.\nIf you have an existing codebase that cannot adopt GCD and uses a custom pthread worker pool, you may benefit from implementing a work-stealing algorithm to achieve optimal performance. For more information, see “Tuning Your Code’s Performance for Apple Silicon.”DispatchTuning Your Code’s Performance for Apple SiliconFurther AMP explorationWhen you adopt GCD and QoS in your application, you can unlock greater processing power and ensure that your application performs well across all Apple platforms.

asking questions, or getting clarifications from Apple engineers, the Apple Developer Forums are a great place to learn and share information about Apple platforms. </p>\n<p>The forums have a ton of great content, and we want to help you get the most out of your visit. Check out some tips and tricks to discover how you can post like a pro, up your reputation, quickly find the best answers, and more.</p><h3>Personalize your profile</h3><p>While anyone can view and browse the forums, you’ll need to sign in with your Apple ID if you want to ask or answer questions. Once you register, you can customize your profile with a preset avatar, add your location if you’re comfortable doing so, and share a link to one of your apps on the App Store. </p>\n<p>Just follow a few simple steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign into your account.</li>\n<li>Go to your profile silhouette in the upper right corner of the screen.</li>\n<li>Click or tap on your silhouette.</li>\n<li>Click or tap <strong>Edit Profile</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From there, you can change whatever you’d like to change, as well as choose to show information like how long you’ve been on the forums.</p><h3>Tag, you’re it</h3><p>The forums are organized by tags: When someone asks a new question, they can add up to four tags to help categorize their post. If you have a question about building watchOS apps with SwiftUI, for example, you might tag that post <strong>SwiftUI</strong> and <strong>watchOS</strong>, and people searching either topic would get it in their search results.</p>\n<p>Tags are listed on every post in the forums: You can view all of the most recent questions filed under a given tag by clicking or tapping on it — as well as check out any relevant technical documentation or information for that tag.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/forums-tags\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">See all available tags on the forums</a></p><h3>Search swiftly</h3><p>Available on every forums page, the search bar lets you look for questions, tags, and profiles. You can supercharge your search queries with a few quick tips — here’s how.</p>\n<p><strong>Keyword search</strong>\nType in a word that’s three characters or longer and hit return to get question titles or descriptions related to the word (or words) you’ve typed.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag search</strong>\nWant to search for a tag? Type it in brackets, like so:</p>\n<p><code>[mac]</code></p><p>This query will return information on tags with the word “mac” in them. Type in the name of a specific tag, and you’ll go straight to the tag’s landing page, which contains a brief description of the tag and a list of recently tagged questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Combination searches</strong>\nIf you know the name of a specific tag or multiple tags, you can combine them with a keyword to further refine your search.

Check out some tips and tricks to discover how you can post like a pro, up your reputation, quickly find the best answers, and more.Personalize your profileWhile anyone can view and browse the forums, you’ll need to sign in with your Apple ID if you want to ask or answer questions. Once you register, you can customize your profile with a preset avatar, add your location if you’re comfortable doing so, and share a link to one of your apps on the App Store. \nJust follow a few simple steps:\n\nSign into your account.\nGo to your profile silhouette in the upper right corner of the screen.\nClick or tap on your silhouette.\nClick or tap Edit Profile.\n\nFrom there, you can change whatever you’d like to change, as well as choose to show information like how long you’ve been on the forums.Tag, you’re itThe forums are organized by tags: When someone asks a new question, they can add up to four tags to help categorize their post. If you have a question about building watchOS apps with SwiftUI, for example, you might tag that post SwiftUI and watchOS, and people searching either topic would get it in their search results.\nTags are listed on every post in the forums: You can view all of the most recent questions filed under a given tag by clicking or tapping on it — as well as check out any relevant technical documentation or information for that tag.See all available tags on the forumsSearch swiftlyAvailable on every forums page, the search bar lets you look for questions, tags, and profiles. You can supercharge your search queries with a few quick tips — here’s how.\nKeyword search\nType in a word that’s three characters or longer and hit return to get question titles or descriptions related to the word (or words) you’ve typed.\nTag search\nWant to search for a tag? Type it in brackets, like so:\n[mac]This query will return information on tags with the word “mac” in them. Type in the name of a specific tag, and you’ll go straight to the tag’s landing page, which contains a brief description of the tag and a list of recently tagged questions.\nCombination searches\nIf you know the name of a specific tag or multiple tags, you can combine them with a keyword to further refine your search. For example:\n[macOS][Beta] CatalystThis search will return all questions that have “Catalyst” in their title or description and are tagged with both “macOS” and “Beta.” \nFind a person\nWant to take a look at someone’s profile? Use the following:\nuser:usernameReplace “username” with the person’s username that you’re looking for to get a list of matching people (or, if you’ve entered an exact match, you’ll visit that person’s profile).Quickly spot Apple Recommended answersWhen browsing forum threads, you can use colors and shapes to quickly learn a bit more about that post.

His story soon reached the producers of Shark Tank, and the rest is Scholly history: Gray’s 60-second pitch resulted in a near-instant deal with Lori Greiner and Daymond John—and some viral offscreen dramatics. (Greiner offered Gray his requested $40,000 without even asking questions. “I don’t care how we monetize,” she said, prompting a minor meltdown in which a number of sharks basically stormed out of the studio.)</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>I realized there’s all this money looking for students, and all these students looking for money.</p></blockquote><p>Scholly Search is the classic example of a simple idea that exploded. Today, it has roughly 3 million users who have landed more than $110 million in scholarships. </p>\n<p>Actor and activist Jesse Williams is a member of Scholly Search’s board; Chance the Rapper has appeared at its Chicago-based initiatives. The company has relocated from Philadelphia to California, into a sprawling corner office with mountain views.</p><p>“The amounts are compelling,” Gray says, “but what’s just as powerful are the stories of people who get, like, the last $3,000 they need to enroll. I always wear my Scholly sweatshirt when I travel, and people come up to me and say, ‘Oh wow, you’re Scholly!’ Not ‘Oh, you’re Chris’ but ‘You’re Scholly!’ And they’ll tell me their story. It’s really powerful to experience that, because, OK, I was a homeless kid.”</p>\n<p>Still in his midtwenties, Gray has been named to Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list for social entrepreneurship and Oprah Winfrey’s “SuperSoul 100” (who are basically her favorite people).

His story soon reached the producers of Shark Tank, and the rest is Scholly history: Gray’s 60-second pitch resulted in a near-instant deal with Lori Greiner and Daymond John—and some viral offscreen dramatics. (Greiner offered Gray his requested $40,000 without even asking questions. “I don’t care how we monetize,” she said, prompting a minor meltdown in which a number of sharks basically stormed out of the studio.)I realized there’s all this money looking for students, and all these students looking for money.Scholly Search is the classic example of a simple idea that exploded. Today, it has roughly 3 million users who have landed more than $110 million in scholarships. \nActor and activist Jesse Williams is a member of Scholly Search’s board; Chance the Rapper has appeared at its Chicago-based initiatives. The company has relocated from Philadelphia to California, into a sprawling corner office with mountain views.“The amounts are compelling,” Gray says, “but what’s just as powerful are the stories of people who get, like, the last $3,000 they need to enroll. I always wear my Scholly sweatshirt when I travel, and people come up to me and say, ‘Oh wow, you’re Scholly!’ Not ‘Oh, you’re Chris’ but ‘You’re Scholly!’ And they’ll tell me their story. It’s really powerful to experience that, because, OK, I was a homeless kid.”\nStill in his midtwenties, Gray has been named to Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list for social entrepreneurship and Oprah Winfrey’s “SuperSoul 100” (who are basically her favorite people). He’s spoken at the Obama Foundation’s My Brother’s Keeper summit and received the 2018 Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award.Christopher Gray’s work got the attention of Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Jesse Williams.In recent years, Gray has set about evolving Scholly into a full-service education app. Scholly Math is an AI-powered standalone app that helps students solve tricky problems (while showing its work, of course). There’s also Scholly Editor, a web-based proofreader. “We originally created it to help with essays,” Gray says, “but a lot of kids are using it to get better grades and learn English, especially in underserved schools.”   Mostly, he hopes to continue helping students reach dreams that circumstances might have once deemed impossible.   “This good thing happened to me,” he says, “and now maybe I can help people who otherwise may not be able to help themselves.”Originally published on the App Store.","guid":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=9cvnv50x","isoDate":"2020-06-04T17:26:43.000Z"},{"title":"Meet the developer: Shine","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=iqeu33mh","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Jun 2020 09:19:29 PDT","content":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/467E4D0D-435A-4678-AA39-FB8116DE3BB4/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"The secret of their self-care app’s success?

Take this article, for instance: You may be reading this text visually; however, if you’re a developer who uses VoiceOver, you’ll hear this paragraph (and the rest of the article) spoken to you along with verbal descriptions of any important elements you might need to know about. And if you’ve opened this article in the Developer app, you’ll also hear about navigational elements in the app.</p>\n<p>Whether you personally use VoiceOver or not, here’s how you can put yourself in the mindset of those who do to help design a standout experience.</p><h3>Master accessibility elements in your app</h3><p>When someone enables VoiceOver on iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, or tvOS, it begins describing all of the labeled elements on screen. To decide what to read, VoiceOver looks for accessibility elements — individual or grouped visual elements within a view — as well as whether someone can interact with these elements. As it describes an element, VoiceOver also highlights it on screen by displaying a black rectangle around the content.</p><hr><p><strong><em>Tip: Explore VoiceOver on your own device</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>While Xcode provides you with several tools to test your app’s accessibility, you can learn a lot about VoiceOver and how various apps have implemented it by taking a test drive on your own iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, or Apple TV. You can enable VoiceOver in the Settings app or System Preferences on your Mac, and if you want to have easy access to the feature, you can even enable a hardware-based Accessibility Shortcut.</em></p><hr><p>VoiceOver also adds a few specific multitouch gestures and taps to help people navigate their device. Swiping to the right anywhere on the screen will navigate to the next element in the view, while swiping to the left will navigate to the previous one. Each time VoiceOver lands on a new element, it speaks details like its accessibility label and value aloud, along with hints or traits if the element has any. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, people may tap directly on a visual element to navigate to it. If it’s within the bounds of an accessibility element, VoiceOver will focus on it. Otherwise, VoiceOver will emit a “boink” sound.</p>\n<p>By default, all standard UIKit controls are accessibility elements. To flag a custom control or view as an accessibility element, you can use <code>isAccessibilityElement</code>:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> isAccessibilityElement: <span class=\"syntax-type\">Bool</span> { <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">get</span> <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">set</span> }</code></pre><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615141-isaccessibilityelement\">Learn more about accessibility elements &gt;</a></p><h3>Group and declutter accessibility elements</h3><p>When navigating by swiping, VoiceOver visits each element in order of its appearance on the screen. That said, this isn’t always the most efficient way for someone to absorb information: If your app has too many accessibility elements, it may take someone a very long time to understand it.

Take this article, for instance: You may be reading this text visually; however, if you’re a developer who uses VoiceOver, you’ll hear this paragraph (and the rest of the article) spoken to you along with verbal descriptions of any important elements you might need to know about. And if you’ve opened this article in the Developer app, you’ll also hear about navigational elements in the app.\nWhether you personally use VoiceOver or not, here’s how you can put yourself in the mindset of those who do to help design a standout experience.Master accessibility elements in your appWhen someone enables VoiceOver on iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, or tvOS, it begins describing all of the labeled elements on screen. To decide what to read, VoiceOver looks for accessibility elements — individual or grouped visual elements within a view — as well as whether someone can interact with these elements. As it describes an element, VoiceOver also highlights it on screen by displaying a black rectangle around the content.Tip: Explore VoiceOver on your own device\nWhile Xcode provides you with several tools to test your app’s accessibility, you can learn a lot about VoiceOver and how various apps have implemented it by taking a test drive on your own iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, or Apple TV. You can enable VoiceOver in the Settings app or System Preferences on your Mac, and if you want to have easy access to the feature, you can even enable a hardware-based Accessibility Shortcut.VoiceOver also adds a few specific multitouch gestures and taps to help people navigate their device. Swiping to the right anywhere on the screen will navigate to the next element in the view, while swiping to the left will navigate to the previous one. Each time VoiceOver lands on a new element, it speaks details like its accessibility label and value aloud, along with hints or traits if the element has any. \nAlternatively, people may tap directly on a visual element to navigate to it. If it’s within the bounds of an accessibility element, VoiceOver will focus on it. Otherwise, VoiceOver will emit a “boink” sound.\nBy default, all standard UIKit controls are accessibility elements. To flag a custom control or view as an accessibility element, you can use isAccessibilityElement:var isAccessibilityElement: Bool { get set }Learn more about accessibility elements >Group and declutter accessibility elementsWhen navigating by swiping, VoiceOver visits each element in order of its appearance on the screen. That said, this isn’t always the most efficient way for someone to absorb information: If your app has too many accessibility elements, it may take someone a very long time to understand it. Instead, look for opportunities to group your accessibility elements together and create a simplified hierarchy. \nWhen you group your accessibility elements, VoiceOver will describe them together, which can speed up navigation through your app. For example, you might group a view that contains a title, text, and a time stamp label, as with Health’s Heart Rate title, heartbeat reading, and time of latest reading.The Health app uses grouped elements in the Summary view to provide a streamlined experience for people using VoiceOver.This also helps provide context for someone using VoiceOver that would otherwise be present in a visual interface: By grouping them and having them read together, this lets people know that the time and text are associated with the title, rather than three unrelated items.Add custom actions You can assign any accessibility element custom actions, which provides extra functionality.
