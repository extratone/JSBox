          <title>Drafts for Mac Status Update</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[agiletortoise]]></dc:creator>
          <category>News &amp; Updates</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>Preview Version Now Available: <a href="https://getdrafts.com/mac/beta" rel="nofollow noopener">Details</a></strong></p>
<p>There has been a lot of interest in Drafts coming to the Mac, so I wanted to give a general update on plans and status of the project as well as a brief preview of what we’ve been working on. Some of the information below is still in flux and may change a little as things shape up, but I expect most of this to remain accurate.</p>
<p>Below is a brief preview video of some of the functionality in place so far…and an FAQ which attempts to address the most common questions about our plans and schedule. I will update this post periodically with new information.</p>
<h2>Preview</h2>
<p>A short video walkthrough show some of the main window operations in Drafts for Mac. Many user interface elements are still being work on, so the final product will likely vary a bit from this demo.</p>
<p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/285326696?app_id=122963">https://vimeo.com/285326696?app_id=122963</a></p></p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>Drafts for Mac? Finally.</h4>
<p>Yes, Drafts is coming to the Mac. Much of the groundwork for this release was done while building the Drafts 5 update. We are now in the process of building the Mac user interface and Mac-specific features.</p>
<h4>What can Drafts for Mac do?</h4>
<p>The initial version of Drafts for Mac will support most of the same draft capture, editing and organization features of Drafts 5 on iOS and all drafts, tags, workspaces, versions, etc. will sync between versions.</p>
<p>The editor will support themes and all the same editing features, syntax highlighting and more.</p>
<p>True to its core, there will be quick-capture tools to easily popup up a window and start typing to start on all your text snippets and notes in Drafts as easily on Mac as you do on iOS.</p>
<h4>What can Drafts for Mac NOT do?</h4>
<p>The initial release of Drafts for Mac is focused on capture, editing and sync. It will not support actions initially. We do plan full action support for the app in the future – but many can benefit from the ability to create, edit and access all their drafts on both platforms in the meantime while we work to complete the somewhat more complex implementation of cross-platform action support.</p>
<h4>Does Drafts for Mac use <code>Marzipan</code> or whatever Apple calls it?</h4>
<p>No. Apple announced tools to <a href="https://www.imore.com/marzipan" rel="nofollow noopener">run iOS apps on Mac coming next year</a>. When those are available we will evaluate whether it makes sense to also incorporate them into the Drafts story, but we want a proper, native Mac experience for Drafts and will be delivering a proper, native Mac app to accomplish that goal.</p>
<h4>When will it be released?</h4>
<p>Too early to tell exactly. We will begin limited beta testing soon and hope to deliver a release near the end of 2018.</p>
<h4>Will Drafts for Mac be a separate purchase?</h4>
<p>Drafts for Mac is part of the Drafts family and will operate similar to the iOS version. It will be free to download and use basic features with more advanced features requiring a <a href="http://getdrafts.com/draftspro" rel="nofollow noopener">Drafts Pro</a> subscription. A single pro subscription will cover use of those advanced features on any supported device - there will not be separate subscription required. So your subscription now is already supporting development and helping us get the Mac version out sooner.</p>
<h4>What about Drafts for <code>X</code>?</h4>
<p>We do not currently have plans for Drafts on platforms other than iOS, macOS and watchOS. Never say never, but these platforms are our focus for the time being.</p>
<h4>How do I keep up with news?</h4>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In the future, I’d love to see the ability to collapse the text below Markdown headers, much like Folding Text does on the Mac, and Editorial on iOS.</p>
<p>Background: I keep a text document open on my Mac all day at the office, and take notes throughout the day as various matters arrive. Right now I use Folding Text on the Mac for this. When I move on from one matter (such as a phone call) to another, I collapse the previous matter by clicking on the Markdown header (pound symbol), which gives me a nice tidy list of what I’ve done that day, with only the current matter expanded and filing the screen.</p>
<p>I’ve uploaded an image showing items unfolded, and one showing only the last item unfolded. Normally my notes under each item are much longer, so the unfolded setup is much messier.</p>

            <p>We all know how that Drafts is God’s gift to iOS users.</p>
<p>A glaring hole in the canon of the Drafts religion of extensibility is the lack of unified access to drafts via a desktop app / web app.</p>
<p>For example, most major note-taking and productivity apps, like Evernote and OneNote, are cross-platform. As a matter of course, a user can access his or her notes on any device or via web platform.</p>
<p>I happen to be a Windows devotee, dare I say. I am not naive enough to ever hope for a Windows version of Drafts, so I pose this question on behalf of of Mac users.</p>
<p>Are there plans to develop a Drafts desktop app or web app?</p>
<p>I am sure this has been posed before, and likely considered.</p>
<p>What is the current answer to this question?</p>

          <title>TIP: Working with task/shopping lists in Drafts</title>

            <p>Task lists with tappable task marks are easy to create in Drafts. We will briefly touch on that below, but this article is focused more on tips to make it easier to check items off the list. Anyone who has ever hit the grocery store with a list of items in a notes app (Drafts, Apple Notes, or others) knows there can be some real annoyances to trying to use that list at the store to check off items and get your shopping done.  If these sound familiar, this article is for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Oops, I meant to tap the checkbox, not edit the note!</em></li>
<li><em>Dang it, my phone went to sleep again, lets do the Face/Touch ID dance to wake it up and check off “Bananas”.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>With a few simple tweaks in Drafts, this can be a lot easier. This article explains several of the options available to make lists work better for you and puts it all together at the end with a single action to enable/disable them all!</p>

<p>The Drafts editor supports simple <a href="https://getdrafts.com/editor/tasks">text-based tasks</a> using square brackets.  In either the <code>Markdown</code> or <code>Simple List</code> syntaxes, simply typing <code>[ ]</code> (open bracket, space, close bracket) creates a tappable task mark.</p>
<p>Drafts also ships with a convenience action called “Tasks” in the “Editing” action group, the default action group for the <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/action-bar">action bar</a>. This action can be <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Bj">reinstalled from the Action Directory</a> if you have deleted it. The “Tasks” action behaves similarly to the checkbox button in the default Apple Notes app, creating or removing task marks at the beginning of each line in the selected text.  This action makes it easy to convert a typed list to tappable marks.  If no text is selected, it simply converts the current line.</p>

<p>Most users keep drafts in the default “Markdown” syntax. This works great for lists, but Drafts allows syntax to be selected on a per-note basis - and each syntax option saves its preferred editor settings (font, font size, margins, etc.) separately. If you change the syntax to “Simple List” for the drafts you use as a list, you can setup a custom configuration optimized for checking off items.  Using a larger font and line height the task marks become bigger targets on the screen and easier to tap.  To change syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your list drafts in the editor.</li>
<li>Select “Aa” appearance settings.</li>
<li>Select the Syntax Highlighting option for the current draft, and change it to “Simple List”.</li>
<li>Make any changes to the editor settings you find are best for working with the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two of Drafts mode options are also helpful when working with a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/focusmode"><strong>Focus Mode</strong></a>: Enabling focus mode disables the automatic creation of new drafts. This means the current draft will remain active when returning to the app. If you are working on a list, checking off items over time, returning to the same list can be very handy.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/linkmode"><strong>Link Mode</strong></a>: The primary purpose of link mode is to enable tapping on web links, emails, and other data in a draft. It also disables editing of a draft while active. This means that an accident tap that misses the task mark will not show the keyboard and start editing - which can be pretty annoying if you are currently just checking off tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="device-sleep-4" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#device-sleep-4"></a>Device Sleep</h3>
<p>iOS tries hard to make your battery last all day, which is excellent. To do so, it automatically dims the screen and then puts your device to sleep after no interaction occurs for some time. When it does this, however, returning to what you were doing requires you to wake up the device and unlock it again using Touch/Face ID or by entering your pin. Sometimes, it’s handy to disable the sleep timer so your device will stay awake, and working on a list is one of those times. If you are at the store or just using the phone as a handy checklist next to you on the desk, disabling sleep allows you to quickly check off the next item on the list without the extra hassle of waking up the device and re-authenticating.</p>
<p>Enabling or disabling system sleep is done via script, but you can install this ready to use <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1NL">Toggle Sleep</a> action to use to switch it off and on.</p>
<h3>
<a name="putting-it-all-together-shopping-mode-5" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#putting-it-all-together-shopping-mode-5"></a>Putting it all together: Shopping Mode</h3>
<p><img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/1X/1bee9ec64ab24717e3ab9b666106bf5c217618ae.png" alt="tasks-shopping-mode" data-base62-sha1="3Z68fPCVZu2MHjnVI2tIKvr3BN4" width="686" height="308"></p>
<p>Taken together, each of these tweaks is handy - but no one wants to get to the grocery store and tap 4-5 different things to get where they can start checking off their list. That’s why we put together an all-in-one action:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1OR"><strong>Toggle Shopping Mode Action</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This action will either enable or disable focus mode, link mode, and the system sleep timer all at once - getting you all ready to work on your list at once.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE - 2021/09/01</strong> Updated action to support a “Omit First Line in New Draft” option, that allows you to use a friendly name for the template in the first line, like “Meeting Notes Template” that is help for selecting templates in the prompt, but will no be included in the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE - 2020/11/01</strong> The current version of this action has been updated with new features, such as cursor placement, as of Nov. 1, 2020. You may need to reinstall the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1VL">action from the directory</a> if you have a previous version installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is often handy to create a new draft based on some boilerplate template content to ease the creation of meetings notes, lists, or other content with repetitive structure. The <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1VL">New Draft with Template</a> example action provides an easy way to do this based on templates maintained in other drafts. Let’s briefly discuss how to use this action to maintain a robust template system in Drafts.</p>
<h2>
<a name="install-the-action-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#install-the-action-1"></a>Install the Action</h2>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1VL">New Draft with Template</a> action in the Action Directory on a device with Drafts installed. Tap the “install” link to install the action and Drafts will launch and prompt to complete the install.</p>

<p>For the “New Draft with Template” action to work, you must first create one or more templates. Do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new draft. Put in the text content you want to use as a template for new drafts in this draft.</li>
<li>Make sure the first line (title) of the draft is something identifiable, as it is used to identify the template when the action is run.</li>
<li>Assign the tag “template” (singular) to the draft.</li>
<li>Assign any additional tags desired. When a new draft is created using a template, any tags (other than “template”) will be assigned to the new draft. So, for example, your “Meeting Notes” template might also have a “meeting” tag so it will automatically be filed properly.</li>
<li>Repeat for any additional templates you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>These template drafts can be in the archive or inbox, but I recommend moving them to the archive to avoid cluttering your inbox. Templates can also be flagged. When the action is run the prompt to select a template sorts based on the text of the draft, but also sorts flagged templates to the top of the select list, so if you flag often used templates they will appear first.</p>

<a name="using-template-tags-3" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#using-template-tags-3"></a>Using Template Tags</h2>
<p>Template drafts can also contain <a href="https://reference.getdrafts.com/topics/templates.html">drafts tags</a>. Tags will be evaluated when new drafts are created using the template, so are great for inserting dynamic time stamps. If you are new to using tags in Drafts, <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-drafts-templates/3728">this is a great guide</a>.</p>
<p>This action also supports a special tag to control placement of the cursor in the newly created draft. If you place the text <code>&lt;|&gt;</code> in your template draft, when this action is used to create a new draft, the <code>&lt;|&gt;</code> will be removed and the cursor placed that location to begin editing. For example, you might wish to use <code>Attendees: &lt;|&gt;</code> in a meeting notes template, and you will start the new draft ready to type in attendees names.</p>

<p>Once you have created one or more templates, run the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1VL">New Draft with Template</a> action.  You will be prompted to select from a list of all your templates. This list is dynamically generated by finding all drafts assigned the tag “template”. So, at any time you can add to or remove templates from the options simply by adding or removing the “template” tag from drafts.</p>
<p>After you select template, the action will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new draft with the content of the template</li>
<li>Assign any additional tags from the template to the new draft</li>
<li>Load the new draft in the editor, ready to edit.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you plan to use this action, it’s a great idea to create a “Templates” <a href="https://getdrafts.com/drafts/workspaces">workspace</a> to keep up with your templates, so you can easily update them as needed. I recommend configuring the workspace with the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tag Filter</strong>: <code>template</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Archive Sort Order</strong>: <code>Text - Ascending</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Archive - Sort flagged to top</strong>: <code>On</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Select Archive</strong> : To automatically switch to archive when loading workspace.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you need to edit your templates, you can open this workspace to access them all in one place easily.</p>

<p>The “New Draft with Template” action is great for use with <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/widgets">iOS Widgets</a>! Add the action to a grid widget on you Home Screen and you can easily jump straight into Drafts with a new draft based on one of your template ready-to-go.</p>

<p>It incorporated a menu that can be called upon by using “d” space. A quick keyword trigger is also available for each one.</p>
<p>It supports:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create New Draft (<strong>dd</strong>)</li>
<li>Search Drafts (<strong>ds</strong>)</li>
<li>Prepend a set Draft (<strong>dp</strong>)</li>
<li>Append a set Draft (<strong>da</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p>3 and 4 require setup in the workflow tool. See end of post for this.</p>
<h2>Menu Driven Actions</h2>
<p>type “d” space and then you’ll get these actions, select one and press enter. Let’s create a new draft.<br>

          <title>Using Drafts Templates</title>

            <h1>
<a name="template-basics-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#template-basics-1"></a>Template Basics</h1>
<p>Drafts actions consist of “steps.” <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/actions/steps/">Action steps</a> are available for a wide range of functions and services: Sending messages, mail, saving files, and much more. Regardless of the purpose of the step, any step that output information has some fields that allow you to control what text the step uses, and (with a few minor exceptions) use templates to dynamically generate that text.</p>
<p>If you have poked around in the action editor and wondered what some of those <code>[[title]]</code> and <code>[[body]]</code> things are, this article is for you.</p>
<p>Templates are plain text combined with tags. Consider tags placeholders for some piece of information you want to be inserted when the action is run. Drafts tags are identified by double square brackets (<code>[[ ]]</code>), surrounding the tag name and options. Most tags insert some content or meta data related to the current draft on which an action is being performed.</p>
<h2>
<a name="common-content-tags-2" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#common-content-tags-2"></a>Common Content Tags</h2>
<p>The tags that get the most use, and which you are likely to see as defaults in many action steps, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>[[draft]]</code></strong> : Replaced with full text of the current draft.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>[[title]]</code></strong> : Replaced with text of the first line of a draft.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>[[body]]</code></strong> : Replace with everything <em>but</em> the first line of the draft.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the “Copy” action, which ships with Drafts in the “Basic” action group. The action places the contents of the current draft in the clipboard. The action itself consists of one <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/system#clipboard">Clipboard action step</a>, with the template <code>[[draft]]</code>.  If you wanted an action that copied just the first line of the draft to the clipboard, you could change the template of the clipboard action step to <code>[[title]]</code>.</p>
<p>The default “Mail” action, which ships with the app, uses the <code>[[title]]</code> tag for the subject line of the email, and <code>[[body]]</code> as the content of the email.</p>

<p>You can mix tags with static text in templates, so you could also have the template string <code>Title: [[title]]</code>, which would produce the first line of the draft, with the prefix <code>Title: </code>.</p>
<p>There is a handy <code>[[line|n]]</code> tag that lets you extract individual or ranges of lines from the content of a draft. The <code>line</code> tag is an example of a tag with a formatting option, separated from the tag name by a <code>|</code> pipe character.  In this case, that option takes line number (1 for the first, 2 for the second, etc.), or range, like <code>1..3</code> for first through the third line.  If you omit the beginning or end line number, the range will assume beginning or end, so <code>..4</code> is the first four lines, and <code>5..</code> is the fifth line to the end of the draft. Negative indexes which count back from the end can also be used, so <code>[[line|-1]]</code> would get you just the last line.</p>
<p>The <code>linke</code> can be very useful in splitting up values from a draft into separate values. Say you want an action that saves to a folder in Dropbox, but you want to specify that in the draft itself. You could type the following draft:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">My File Name
Personal

The content of the draft.
</code></pre>
<p>Then have an action configured with a <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#dropbox">Dropbox action step</a> using the following template values for its fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Name</strong>: <code>[[line|1]].txt</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Path</strong>: <code>/[[line|2]]/</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Template</strong>: <code>[[line|3..]]</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Using this action, on the draft sample text above would result in a file on Dropbox named “My File Name.txt” in the folder “Personal”, with the content “The content of the draft.”</p>
<h2>
<a name="date-and-time-tags-3" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#date-and-time-tags-3"></a>Date and Time Tags</h2>
<p>Another commonly used set of tags are date-related tags. The available date tags are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>[[date]]</code></strong>: Current date, defaulting to the format <code>%Y-%m-%d</code>, which is equivalent to YYYY-MM-DD.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>[[created]]</code></strong>: The date the current draft was created.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>[[modified]]</code></strong>: The date the content of the current draft was last modified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these tags can also take a formatting string, after the <code>|</code> separator, using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a> formatting. There are formatting characters to allow configuration of almost any possible date and time string - including year, month names, day names, and much more. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/strftime.3.html">Apple strftime reference</a> has details on all the available options. A few commonly used format examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>[[date|%Y-%m-%d]]</code> : <em>Result:</em> 2019-01-31</li>
<li>
<code>[[date|%I:%M %p]]</code> : <em>Result:</em> 06:19 PM</li>
<li>
<code>[[date|%d %B %Y %H:%M:%S]]</code> : <em>Result:</em> 31 January 2019 21:19:20</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Drang wrote an <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/02/new-flexible-timestamps-in-drafts/">excellent blog post about date tags in Drafts</a> which is an excellent resource as well.</p>
<p>To test formats, we also recommend <a href="http://strftime.net">strftime.net</a>, an online format builder which previews the output of format strings.</p>
<p>The most common use case for date tags is timestamping when appending to a daily journal file, or starting a draft from a template.</p>
<h2>
<a name="additional-tags-4" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#additional-tags-4"></a>Additional Tags</h2>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates">template tag reference</a> for a complete list of available built-in tags. Using tags you can access information like location data stored with a draft, its UUID and permalink, tags, and more.</p>
<h2>
<a name="no-tags-required-5" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#no-tags-required-5"></a>No Tags Required</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that just because templates in actions can contain tags to dynamically insert text, they don’t need to. Many times you just want plain static text in a template to add boilerplate snippets,</p>
<h2>
<a name="special-template-markup-6" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#special-template-markup-6"></a>Special Template Markup</h2>
<p>In addition to tags, there are a couple of special markup conventions used in templates for convenience, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><code>{{ }}</code></strong> : Any text between double curly braces will be URL encoded for use in URL query parameters. This is typically used in <a href="https://getdrafts.com/actions/steps/openurl">Open URL action steps</a> to properly encode text to be included in a URL.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>%% %%</code></strong> : Any text between double percent signs will be converted from Markdown to HTML using your default <a href="https://getdrafts.com/settings/markdown">Markdown options</a>. Useful when publishing to locations that want HTML input.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>&lt;&lt;textexpander-shortcut&gt;&gt;</code></strong> <em>[iOS Only]</em> : If you use <a href="https://textexpander.com/">TextExpander</a>, it is possible to dynamically expand a TextExpander snippet when a template is evaluated. Generally useful for snippets you do not want to be expanded until the action is run because they contain dates or other output which is time-sensitive. To expand a snippet in a template, wrap the snippet’s shortcut text in <code>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="conclusion-7" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#conclusion-7"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With just a few tweaks to templates, you can create an array of useful actions that save time and formatting.</p>

<p>That site is run by the developers of the Mac application The Archive, an application specifically designed for use with Zettelkastens. If you are interested in learning more about Zettelkastens, their site is the place to go.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that I am by no means an expert – the essential differences between a Zettelkasten and a standard note-taking system are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wiki-style links between notes. The assumption is that insights (new knowledge) emerge from a group of notes inter-connected with links. Adding more linked notes creates more knowledge. By contrast, adding more unconnected notes creates an increasingly useless pile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of “structure notes” that consist of links forming a table of contents (or index if you prefer). Structure notes provide entry points into a web of inter-connected notes. A Zettelkasten might have multiple structure notes depending upon the system’s size and complexity. In addition to links, structure notes may contain brief explanatory text. The Drafts Scripts Reference provides an example of how structure notes work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on “atomicity” of notes. Atomicity encourages notes to be short, each devoted to a narrowly defined subject, making them easier to link to other narrowly focused notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notes based on the user’s appreciation of a subject, not (exclusively) based upon clipped or quoted information. Creating notes based on my understanding of an issue is different from my typical activity with Bear–i.e.,  assembling an ever-growing and increasingly less useful pile of clipped web articles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When Version 20 of Drafts added linking capability, I imported (my first) Zettelkasten from The Archive. My principal reasons for making the switch:</p>
<p>(1) I wanted a system that worked with both macOS and iOS. If I was going to spend time developing a Zettelkasten I wanted to be able to carry it with me, in the same manner that I carry my calendar, contacts database, and task manager with me. In addition, I frequently encounter Zettelkasten-related information while not in front of my iMac. The Archive’s macOS-only limitation in this regard may be a result of its origins–use cases where information is largely obtained from books and journal articles in an office setting. The Mac-only approach rules out numerous other possibilities such as a birder recording sightings, a school principal evaluating teachers, a field engineer inspecting a facility, an eighth-grader with an iPad but not a Mac, a salesman making client calls, a personal trainer making notes about clients in a gym, etc.</p>
<p>(2)  Note creation and management is dependent upon operations that Drafts can streamline without reliance upon third-party solutions such as Keyboard Maestro or Alfred. Much as I depend upon Keyboard Maestro and Alfred for other purposes, they don’t work on iOS, and  they are not needed to manage a Zettelkasten in Drafts.</p>
<p>In Drafts, each Zettelkasten exists within a workspace. You can create more than one Zettelkasten, each using its own workspace. Structure notes can be flagged and set to sort at the top of lists where they can be immediately found. An Action Group containing Zettelkasten-related operations can be assigned to one of the two action group defaults for the workspace.</p>
<p>The Zettelkasten-related actions I have assembled came directly from the Actions Directory. My JavaScript ability is near zero and my only contribution to these actions was to modify a few template definitions.</p>
<p>This group of Zettelkasten-related actions works on my iPhone and iPad as well as on my iMac.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start from a draft, typically a structure note.  The action prompts for a title and tags for a new note, with the tag(s) used in the structure note suggested as a default. The action then creates the new note using an easily configurable template embedded in the action. It also creates links from the structure note to the new note and vice versa. This is a frequently used action and it is very efficient.</li>
<li>Start from a draft and display all drafts within the workspace. Choose one. The action uses the selected draft’s title to insert a link in the starting draft.</li>
<li>Go back to the last draft.</li>
<li>Prompt for a new title for an existing draft. The action changes the title and then searches the workspace, updating any links that depend on the old title. This action makes it unnecessary (IMO) to employ the 12-digit UID (yyyymmddhhmm) used by The Archive to ensure that changing a title does not break links. For the unconvinced, a UID can be created in Drafts as easily as it can in The Archive.</li>
<li>Display all drafts that link to the current draft.</li>
<li>Create a link to Bear using the title of a Bear note in the clipboard. While plain text has advantages, easy incorporation of other file types is not one of them. Links to Bear largely solve that problem.</li>
<li>Create a standard Markdown link using a url in the clipboard.</li>
<li>Create a draft from scratch, using what I consider to be my “standard template”.</li>
<li>Create a draft from scratch, using a template that I prefer to use when capturing and commenting upon text from the web.</li>
<li>Rename a tag.</li>
</ul>
<p>A frequently-voiced concern re Drafts in the Zettelkasten community is that drafts are stored in a special database, making their long-term viability suspect. In the thread “Error sending Drafts docs to iA Writer” I discovered two actions written by <a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/davenicholls">@davenicholls</a> that export drafts to iCloud where they can be accessed by iA Writer – and also by The Archive. Links and Markdown formatting are preserved. In the Actions Directory, see:</p>
<p>Send to iA Writer</p>
<p>Send multiple to iA Writer</p>
<p>These two actions (and there may be similar functionality that I have not discovered) should ease concerns about the long-term viability of a Zettelkasten created in Drafts.</p>
<p>When I first imported notes from The Archive to Drafts I was concerned that “date created” was not preserved. All creation dates were the date of import. After using Drafts for a Zettelkasten for a few months, I believe that my concern was mis-placed. IMO, it is more important to focus on date accessed than date created. If a draft/note has not been accessed for months, one of two things is probably true: (a) It has no value and should be deleted, or (b) it has been overlooked for too long and deserves your attention. Any note actually created in Drafts (versus imported) will have the “correct” date created.</p>
<p>On the Zettlekasten Forum there are numerous discussions regarding the optimum template to use with notes. IMO, there is no optimum. The information needed by a birder recording a sighting is much different from the information needed by a therapist or a field engineer. Drafts easily accommodates multiple templates.</p>
<p>There are four other considerations that I think bear on a decision regarding choice of software for a Zettelkasten: (1) The exceptionally high quality as well as the depth and breadth of documentation that Greg provides. (2) The extraordinary speed with which Greg is providing new functionality. (3) The amplifying affect of a community that uses the extensive scripting options available in Drafts to enhance the application’s utility. (4) The fact that a Zettelkasten is only one of a large number of functions that Drafts supports. Using Drafts for one function develops expertise useful for others.</p>
<p>Bottomline: If you want to try using a Zettelkasten and already use Drafts, you need look no further.</p>

          <title>An Alfred Workflow for Drafts</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[sylumer]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Drafts for Mac</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>If as well as being a Mac user of Drafts, you are also an <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred app</a> user, then this post might be for you.</p>
<p>I’ve recently been updating and sharing some of <a href="https://www.thoughtasylum.com/alfred/">my Alfred workflows</a>, and I’m now in a position to share one I created for Drafts. I pulled together some separate workflows I had created over the course of the last year or two, and slowly started building it out. It may have grown a bit more than I’d originally anticipated.</p>
<p>You can download the workflow and read through the documentation and guides (<em>yes, that really is how much it grew</em>) at <a href="https://doctordrafts.thoughtasylum.com">doctordrafts.thoughtasylum.com</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a flavour of <em>some</em> of the sorts of things that are possible in this first release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating new drafts in the foreground or background (supporting newlines and tabs too).</li>
<li>Searching for drafts by content or title (filtering the results live in Alfred).</li>
<li>Copying the content of or URL to open a draft to the clipboard.</li>
<li>Prepending and appending to drafts (again supporting newlines and tabs).</li>
<li>Jump directly to various documentation pages on a variety of domains (also copy the URL or a Markdown link).</li>
<li>View local quick reference information (available offline).</li>
<li>Generate Drafts-styled feedback e-mails.</li>
<li>Run a Drafts action by name.</li>
<li>Open a new draft for dictation.</li>
<li>Options for easily building your own custom Alfred workflows on top of it (worked examples provided + technical documentation).
<ul>
<li>Append to a daily log, built to your own titling specification is one of the use case examples.</li>
<li>Create a capture board for running a hotkey driven text capture draft is another of the use case examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a 1.0 release. It has had some beta testing, but there’s always the chance something’s not quite right. Any issues, just post something in this thread.</p>
<p>Likewise, I’m open to suggestions for improvements (<em>though I’m not promising to apply them</em> <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ), I will add stuff and check stuff off on the roadmap (on the website).  I’d also love to see what customised workflows people come up with. Please do add to this thread and we’ll see where it goes.</p>
<p>There’s a general intro on <a href="https://www.thoughtasylum.com/2021/04/22/alfred-workflow-drafts/">my blog</a>, but the download and lots more information are on <a href="https://doctordrafts.thoughtasylum.com">doctordrafts.thoughtasylum.com</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, for the particularly geeky amongst you, and I know there are quite a few of you, here is a high level view of what the workflow looks like in Alfred.</p>

            <p><strong>Seems about time that I did this.</strong></p>
<p>As an OmniFocus user and a Drafts fan it’s about time I learned JavaScript. I’ve been meaning to learn some basic programming skills for a while and now seems a great opportunity because I get the feeling I could make a lot of huge workflow gains if I had a JS under my belt.</p>
<p>Learning is easier if you do it in a group, especially if that group is mixed ability, including some who can deepen their learning by helping others. So this is me raising a flag to see if anyone fancies doing this with me.</p>
<p>I’m guessing we could use this forum as a place to collaborate on our learning. Perhaps a slack group might be easier? Im open to ideas.</p>
<p>So, who’s up for it?</p>

          <title>Things Parser 2.0</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[pdavisonreiber]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Actions - Share What You&#39;ve Made</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Just published version 2.0 of my Things Parser.</p>
<p>Action Directory link: <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1DV" rel="nofollow noopener">http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1DV</a></p>
<p>More info below:</p>
<h1>Things Parser</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>This script action sends each line of the draft to Things 3. Special characters can be added to each line (after the task name) to create additional metadata about the task.</p>
<p>The syntax is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="hashtag">#Project</span> Name</li>
<li>
<span class="mention">@Tag</span> Name</li>
<li>==Heading</li>
<li>//Task note</li>
<li>!Natural Language Deadline String</li>
<li>*Checklist Item</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these markup characters should be immediately preceded by a space. The task name must come first in the line. The date and time of the event can be written in natural language anywhere in the line, and does not require a special character. The script also automatically detects whether or not a time has been written. If a date and time are written, it adds a task with that date and a reminder at that time. If only a date is written, it doesn’t add a reminder.</p>
<p>Multiple tags and checklist items can be entered.</p>
<p>Special characters can be used elsewhere in the line, as long as they are not immediately preceded by a space, so for example the following is fine.</p>
<p>//Note containing email address: <a href="mailto:me@domain.com">me@domain.com</a></p>
<p>is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>Task name
</code></pre>
<p><em>Adds item to Inbox</em></p>
<pre><code>Task name on Wednesday
</code></pre>
<p><em>Adds item to Upcoming with Wednesday as date</em></p>
<pre><code>Task name on Wednesday at 6pm
</code></pre>
<p><em>Adds item to Upcoming with Wednesday as date and a reminder at 6pm</em></p>
<pre><code>Task name on Wednesday at 6pm !Friday
</code></pre>
<p><em>Same as above with a deadline of Friday</em></p>
<pre><code>Task name on Wednesday at 6pm #Project Name ==Heading @Tag 1 @Tag 2 ++Additional Note !Friday *first thing *second thing *third thing
</code></pre>
<p><em>Adds item to project called <code>Project Name</code> under <code>Heading</code> with date of Wednesday, reminder at 6pm, two tags <code>Tag 1</code> and <code>Tag 2</code>, an additional note <code>Additional Note</code>, and a checklist with the following three items:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>first thing</code></li>
<li><code>second thing</code></li>
<li><code>third thing</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Block-Based Entry</h2>
<p>To save time in entering metadata, if the first line of a block of text contains only metadata, this will be inherited by every other line in that block. So instead of writing:</p>
<pre><code>task 1 today
task 2 today
task 3 today
</code></pre>
<p>you can simply write:</p>
<pre><code>Today
task 1
task 2
task 3
</code></pre>
<p>This works with all possible metadata:</p>
<pre><code>today at 5pm !Friday #Project ==Heading @Tag 1 @Tag 2 *checklist item 1 *checklist item 2 //note
task 1
task 2
task 3
</code></pre>
<p>If a task has metadata that conflicts with the block heading, the task’s metadata wins, but it will still inherit anything that doesn’t conflict. So things like this are fine:</p>
<pre><code>#Project !Friday
Task 1
Task 2 !Monday
Task 3
</code></pre>
<p>Task 2 will be added to <code>Project</code> but will have a different deadline to the other tasks.</p>
<p>Multiple blocks can be entered within a single draft and should be separated by a blank line.</p>
<h2>New Project Creation</h2>
<p>Using the syntax <code>+Project</code> you can create a new project and add tasks to it. It works in two different modes: in-line and block-based.</p>
<h3>In-Line</h3>
<p>With the in-line mode you can just add <code>+Project</code> to the end of any line and it will create a new project with that task as the only entry. Headings can also be created, and an area can be specified. Any other metadata is assigned to the task:</p>
<pre><code>task +Project ==Heading #Area today at 5pm !Friday
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a project called <code>Project</code> in <code>Area</code> with a heading and a single task under that heading. The task is assigned to today, has a reminder for 5pm, and has a deadline of Friday.</p>
<h3>Block-Based</h3>
<p>Block-based mode works in similar way with a couple of small changes: all metadata on the block heading is inherited by the new project, not the tasks, and multiple headings can be specified. Metadata must be specified for each task individually. If a task is given one of the headings specified in the block heading, it will be put under that heading, otherwise it will be assigned to the project with no heading.</p>
<pre><code>+Project today at 5pm ==Heading 1 ==Heading 2 #Area @tag
Task with no heading
Task under heading 1 ==Heading 1
Task under heading 2 ==Heading 2
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the date and tag will be added to the project, <em>not</em> the tasks.</p>
<p>It is possible to combine the project creation feature with the block-based task metadata inheritance using two blocks, one which creates the new project, and then another which adds tasks under it. So for example, if I wanted to create an important work project due on Friday with three tasks I wanted to work on today, I could do the following:</p>
<pre><code>+Project #Work !Friday @Important

today #Project
task 1
task 2
task 3</code></pre>

          <title>Using Apple Notes with Drafts</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[agiletortoise]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Integration Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/1X/f9cef0215f5b4b289868f873ac8f3f09fcd81113.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="zDUfFGYWYZ5iL12nKprGvNK1IRl" width="118" height="118"></p>
<p>This is a short article, but we do get asked often how to integrate with the built-in Apple Notes app.  Unfortunately, at this time, Apple does not provide ways to integrate with Notes that would allow more direct, interaction-free integration with third-party apps. You can, of course, always copy and paste from Drafts into a note in Notes, but we cover the other options below…</p>
<h2>Using the “Share” Action</h2>
<p>Content can be sent to Apple Notes via its Share extension on both iOS and Mac.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1BF">Share</a> action, which comes in the default “Basic” action group and select the “Notes” app.  From this share extension, the draft text can be added to Notes as a new note, or appended to an existing note.</p>
<p>If you share often, it might also be useful to install the <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1BF">Share (selection)</a> action, which sends only the current text selection, not the entire draft.</p>
<h2>Using Shortcuts (iOS only)</h2>
<p>On iOS, Apple’s Shortcuts app has additional abilities to integrate with Notes that are not available directly to third party apps…including creating notes in specific folders, appending to notes, and doing these things without any additional interaction.</p>
<p>Drafts can trigger Shortcuts using the <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/advanced.html#run-shortcut">Run Shortcut</a> action step.</p>
<p>For a simple example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/133201c2b9d047ddb4975ee3f0331d34">Create note in Notes</a> example shortcut. It is configured to create a note with the content input to the shortcut.</li>
<li>Install edit <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/13T">Create note in Notes</a> example Drafts action, which calls the above shortcut.</li>
<li>Create a draft, and run the action.</li>
<li>Go to Notes, and find your new note!</li>
</ul>
<p>This same basic setup can be used with additional shortcuts configured to send to specific folders, etc. The details of configuring such shortcuts is a little beyond what I can cover in this article. If you plan to configure additional Shortcuts, <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-calling-shortcuts-from-drafts/3603">this article on adding Shortcuts to Drafts</a> is worth a read.</p>
<h2>AppleScript (Mac Only)</h2>
<p>On the Mac, Drafts ability to run AppleScripts can be used to integrate with Notes. We have provided a <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/16g">Markdown to Notes</a> example action to get you started with the possibilities.</p>

          <title>Drafts as a bare bones knowledge management system</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[jsamlarose]]></dc:creator>
          <category>General Discussion</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I just tweaked a script for some quick and easy cross-linking between posts (<a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/11Q" class="inline-onebox">Cross link drafts | Drafts Action Directory</a>). That got me wondering how many other people are using Drafts as a knowledge management base, and whether anyone had any tips or tricks to share.</p>
<p>I’m drawing on thoughts from things like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/T382CLwAjsy3fmecf/how-to-take-smart-notes-ahrens-2017">How to take smart notes (Ahrens, 2017)</a> and <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/v8/help/page/Vu1MmjinS">the Roam research white paper</a> (which is in itself an intriguing proposition but still in the early days of its development).</p>
<p>I know there are other apps for this kind of thinking (DevonThink, Evernote, even Notion, etc), but having tried most/all of them over the years, I’m still very comfortable in Drafts. Just curious to know if anyone else is doing anything that I might be able to learn from.</p>
<p>Any and all thoughts gratefully received.</p>

<h1>
<a name="using-notion-with-drafts-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#using-notion-with-drafts-1"></a>Using Notion with Drafts</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Notion integration requires Drafts v31 or greater. The Notion API used for integration is still in beta, as such aspects of this functionality may change or break and Notion finalizes their API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> is an online project management and information system. Drafts currently two ways to integrate with Notion:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#notion">Notion action step</a>. Can create new sub-pages, or append to existing pages, as plain text or as to-do lists.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://scripting.getdrafts.com/classes/notion"><code>Notion</code> script object</a>: Provides a <code>request</code> method which allows you to script calls to the full Notion API, while providing automatic OAuth authenticate flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>The action step provides a basic, easy to approach way to get your data from Drafts to Notion. Scripting supports advanced integration, for users needing to work with databases and other block types in Notion.</p>
<h2>
<a name="notion-authentication-and-permissions-2" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#notion-authentication-and-permissions-2"></a>Notion Authentication and Permissions</h2>
<p>Like most services Drafts integrates with, Notion uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth standard</a> for authentication. The first time you use an action that integrates with Notion, you will be redirected to the Notion website and asked to log in and authorize Drafts to use your account.</p>
<p>When authenticating, Notion has an additional step of selecting specific pages in Notions which the integration will be granted permissions to access. It is recommended you give Drafts permissions <em>only</em> to the pages you plan to target with actions.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/27e6dbf034b521ba318be9a70426e1e426e6424f.png" data-download-href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/27e6dbf034b521ba318be9a70426e1e426e6424f" title="notion-authentication"><img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/27e6dbf034b521ba318be9a70426e1e426e6424f_2_690x367.png" alt="notion-authentication" data-base62-sha1="5GZeyq75fzyHzjsUiUFdzmCuZH1" width="690" height="367" srcset="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/27e6dbf034b521ba318be9a70426e1e426e6424f_2_690x367.png, https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/27e6dbf034b521ba318be9a70426e1e426e6424f.png 1.5x, https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/27e6dbf034b521ba318be9a70426e1e426e6424f.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/27e6dbf034b521ba318be9a70426e1e426e6424f_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>After you have authorized Drafts, you can add and remove page permissions in the Notion interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the Notion Page you wish to add to the Drafts integration.</li>
<li>Select “Share”, then “Invite” and select the “Drafts” integration to allow it permission to use the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Permissions are inherited, so granting Drafts permission to access a page or workspace, gives it permission to access child elements of that item.</p>
<p>If “Drafts” does not appear as an option when to invite in your share page, make sure you have run a Notion action in Drafts and successfully authenticated to the correct workspace in Notion.</p>
<h2>
<a name="notion-action-step-3" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#notion-action-step-3"></a>Notion Action Step</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#notion">Notion action step</a> can add text or to-do lists to pages in Notion. Aspects of this step may change, but it’s a start. To get started, install an example action:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1uS">Notion-Create Page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1uC">Notion-Append as Text</a></li>
<li><a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1uT">Notion-Append as To-Do List</a></li>
<li><a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1uD">Notion-Append as To Do List</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By default, these examples ask you to select a Notion page as a target each time they are run. They can also be configured to target a specific page by page ID. See next section on obtaining IDs, and the <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#notion">step documentation</a> for further details on options available.</p>
<h2>
<a name="obtaining-notion-page-ids-4" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#obtaining-notion-page-ids-4"></a>Obtaining Notion Page IDs</h2>
<p>To configure action steps to target a specific page in Notion, you can use the “Select” button in the action step configuration, or obtain a specific Page ID from Notion.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c6afb1dafb77ecd3b9e378ea170f52171c3a4ae1.png" data-download-href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/c6afb1dafb77ecd3b9e378ea170f52171c3a4ae1" title="notion-page-id"><img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c6afb1dafb77ecd3b9e378ea170f52171c3a4ae1_2_690x386.png" alt="notion-page-id" data-base62-sha1="slEXJlvCo6JOqrUZk8k0MMP56jD" width="690" height="386" srcset="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c6afb1dafb77ecd3b9e378ea170f52171c3a4ae1_2_690x386.png, https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c6afb1dafb77ecd3b9e378ea170f52171c3a4ae1.png 1.5x, https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c6afb1dafb77ecd3b9e378ea170f52171c3a4ae1.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c6afb1dafb77ecd3b9e378ea170f52171c3a4ae1_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>To get a page ID:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the page in the Notion website or app.</li>
<li>Use the “Share” button, and “Copy Link” to get the unique URL for the page.</li>
<li>The Page ID is the string of numbers and letters at the end of the URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you obtain that page ID, you can paste it in an action and change the action to “Assign” the target page.</p>
<p><em>Be sure the page you wish to target has been invited to the “Drafts” integration (see permissions section above) or the action will fail.</em></p>
<h2>
<a name="using-the-notion-api-in-script-5" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#using-the-notion-api-in-script-5"></a>Using the Notion API in Script</h2>
<p>For advanced users, Drafts also provides a <a href="https://scripting.getdrafts.com/classes/notion">Notion Script object</a> that allows you to make requests directly against the Notion API. Any API calls can be used, see <a href="https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro">Notion API docs</a> for information on available methods. This object may add convenience methods for some functions, but right now only has a single <code>request</code> method that allows for arbitrary calls against the Notion API. Example action:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1uE">Notion: List Pages</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="notion-and-markdownrich-texthtml-6" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#notion-and-markdownrich-texthtml-6"></a>Notion and Markdown/Rich Text/HTML</h2>
<p>Notion stores text in its own <a href="https://developers.notion.com/reference/block">structured block format</a>. In their own apps and web version, they have tools that convert between Markdown pasted into the interface, and this native block format.</p>
<p>At this time, Notion has not added the ability to convert between this native block format and HTML or Markdown to the capabilities of the API.</p>
<p>It is possible to construct Notion blocks using JavaScript in Drafts (they are just complex JSON objects), and pass those values to the API, but due to the complexity of the format, we do not have any automated tools to do this conversion.</p>
<p>We are hoping Notion adds this capability before the API is final, and we will certain support it to provide a smoother way to pass Markdown and/or HTML to Notion if they do.</p>

            <p>2021 has been a busy year for Drafts. I am, generally speaking, a person who prefers to spend their time contemplating the present and future, but it’s not a bad idea to look back now and then and remind yourself of what you have accomplished.</p>

<p>I would like to thank everyone who uses Drafts, those that support the app with a Pro subscription, and all the great community members who share their time and creative solutions with others – both on this forum and elsewhere!</p>
<p>I don’t like to be too specific about future plans, but we have a lot of good things coming in 2022…including celebrating the 10th anniversary of Drafts’ original 1.0 release (Yikes!).</p>
<p>Here’s hoping 2022 is great for you and yours, and thanks again for using Drafts!</p>

<a name="shortcuts-for-mac-macos-12-support-3" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#shortcuts-for-mac-macos-12-support-3"></a>Shortcuts for Mac / macOS 12 Support</h2>
<p>Drafts provides a <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/shortcuts">wide variety of actions</a> for use in Apple’s automation app, Shortcuts. These can be used for simple things like creating a new draft, opening Drafts directly to specific workspaces – or advanced processing by querying and updating multiple drafts.</p>
<p><img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c03661855cd7be470de62371bc76ebfb7622151f.jpeg" alt="r29-4" data-base62-sha1="rqobsY3bYaNjFgeIqYJk11m6xKD" width="480" height="297"></p>
<p>With macOS 12, Apple has brought the power of Shortcuts to the Mac, and Drafts is ready. All Drafts’ Shortcuts actions now work on both iOS and Mac, and shortcuts created using these actions work cross-platform, allowing you to create, modify, and use those shortcuts on all your devices!</p>
<h2>
<a name="autocomplete-4" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#autocomplete-4"></a>Autocomplete</h2>
<p>Drafts now includes an extensible system to provide drop-down autocomplete suggestions while typing in the editor. Autocomplete includes a global system for creating and inserting text snippets. Additional autocomplete suggestions can also be provided by <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/docs/extending/syntaxes">syntax definitions</a>.</p>
<h3>
<a name="global-autcomplete-suggestions-5" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#global-autcomplete-suggestions-5"></a>Global Autcomplete Suggestions</h3>
<p>Do you have snippets of text you reuse regularly? Email addresses? Templates? Then autocomplete suggestions will be a handy addition.</p>
<p><img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5353b059293f9b0421ebc37d49d64ec88051f201.png" alt="r29-3" data-base62-sha1="bT8VOVD9hqAR5Havvsb9GN4cBvH" width="480" height="297"></p>
<p>Visit the <code>Autocomplete</code> tab in Editor Preferences (<code>Aa</code> button below editor) to get started configuring your suggestion drop-down items. Set the “Trigger” text to control what sequence of characters will trigger the suggestion drop-down to appear, and add items for frequently used snippets. Suggestions can use <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates">Drafts template tags</a> to insert the current date, location, or other values.</p>
<h3>
<a name="link-completion-and-draft-insertion-6" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#link-completion-and-draft-insertion-6"></a>Link Completion and Draft Insertion</h3>
<p>Drafts built-in Markdown syntaxes (Markdown, GitHub Markdown, and MultiMarkdown) now include two additional autocompletion features to work with other drafts in your library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type <code>[[</code> to trigger auto-completion of <code>[[wiki-style]]</code> links to other drafts by title.</li>
<li>Type <code>&lt;&lt;</code> to trigger the selection of another draft and insert the full content of that draft.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fdfd8ba546ea3bc2777e12b0729f82eaf20cb986.png" alt="r29-2" data-base62-sha1="AeU1a0nCZ75hZsnLCIZHo15UJVk" width="480" height="297"></p>
<p>These features are implemented using a new set of configuration options available to all syntax definitions. If you create custom syntax definitions, and would like to add this functionality (or similar) to your custom syntax definitions, take a look at the related documentation on <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/docs/extending/development/syntax-format.html#autocomplete-definitions">autocomplete in syntaxes</a></p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We are super excited to launch <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/web-capture">Drafts Web Capture</a>, a new way to capture text to your Drafts library, from any modern web browser, on any platform!</p>
<h2>
<a name="what-is-drafts-web-capture-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#what-is-drafts-web-capture-1"></a>What is Drafts Web Capture?</h2>
<p>Drafts Web Capture is a web page that integrates directly with your Drafts iCloud storage, allowing the creation of drafts from any web browser on any platform. Key use cases for Drafts Web Capture:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>You are someplace you do not have access to the Drafts app directly.</strong> On a Windows PC at work? Have an Android tablet? Now you can capture that idea directly to Drafts without pulling out your iPhone.</li>
<li>
<strong>You want to use Drafts as a bookmark library, read-it-later service, or general research tool to keep up with links and text quotes from web pages.</strong> Combined with a bookmarklet (examples below), Draft Web Capture makes it smooth and easy to enable such workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Drafts Web Capture should work in most modern browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) on any platform (Windows, Linux, Android - as well as macOS, iOS).</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thank you for building Drafts and making it such a powerful and elegant tool.</p>
<p>Can you please consider to integrate Notion support slowly but surely into Drafts? This would be very helpful as most of my writing starts in Drafts but ends up in my digital note archive.</p>
<p>After 10 years of Evernote, I switched to Notion in a heartbeat after trying it out for a day. It is so powerful and adds many, many advantages to my digital archive. I am convinced it is going to have a huge appeal to advanced digital note-takers (=people that use Drafts) and is going to grow in importance over the next months and years.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration and keep up the good work <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<h2>
<a name="importing-from-reminders-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#importing-from-reminders-1"></a>Importing From Reminders</h2>
<p>Drafts can import reminders from a list in the iOS Reminders app. If you enable this feature, when drafts is launched, it will look for a list in the Reminders app, and create drafts using the title and note content of any incomplete tasks in that list. After successful import, it will mark those tasks as complete to prevent duplicate imports.</p>
<p>The default list to import from is “Drafts”, but the list name you wish to import from can be changed in settings.</p>
<p>If you are using iCloud sync for Reminders, you can add to the “Drafts” reminder list in the Reminders app on OS X.  The reminders will sync to your iOS devices, then be imported into Drafts the next time it launches on your iPhone or iPad if you have enabled the “Import reminders” feature.</p>
<h2>
<a name="creating-reminders-2" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#creating-reminders-2"></a>Creating Reminders</h2>
<p>Drafts has two action steps that can also create individual reminders, or full lists of reminders in very flexible ways. For information on export to reminders read about the <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/system#reminder">Reminders</a> and <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/system#list-in-reminders">List in Reminders</a> action steps.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1E8"><strong>Reminder</strong></a>: Creates a single reminder task using the first line of the draft as the title and remain text as a note.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1E7"><strong>List in Reminders</strong></a>: Adds each line of the draft as a separate reminder task. This action can be modified to point to a specific list, or the first line of the draft can specify a list dynamically by started with a # character.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Rr"><strong>Reminder with options</strong></a>: Prompts to create a reminder with a number of options for setting due date, priority and selecting target list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="scripting-reminders-4" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#scripting-reminders-4"></a>Scripting Reminders</h2>
<p>For more advanced integrations, Drafts can script reading and writing of Reminders and Reminder lists. Visit the <a href="https://reference.getdrafts.com/objects/Reminder.html">Reminder</a> and <a href="https://reference.getdrafts.com/objects/ReminderList.html">ReminderList</a> scripting documentation for details.</p>
<h4>
<a name="reminder-and-privacy-settings-5" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#reminder-and-privacy-settings-5"></a>Reminder and Privacy Settings</h4>
<p>For any of Drafts reminders integration features to work, you must allow Drafts access to Reminders.</p>
<p>The first time you attempt to use any Reminders-related features in Drafts, you will be asked for permission.  If you “Don’t Allow” and later want to enable access, visit the iOS Settings app, under Privacy to enable Drafts access.</p>

<a name="transcribe-text-from-audio-and-video-files-3" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#transcribe-text-from-audio-and-video-files-3"></a>Transcribe Text from Audio and Video Files</h3>
<p>Drafts now registers itself to open most common audio and video formats. If you open an audio or video file in Drafts, you will be prompted with an option to transcribe text using speech recognition. Speech recognition will process the audio in the same way as dictation, so dictation commands for punctuation, etc., are supported.</p>
<p>This is most useful for transcribing the content of single-speaker voice audio, like a voice memo, or recorded lecture, but it will happily attempt to transcribe other forms of audio as well, though the quality of the results may vary.</p>
<p>To try it out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>iOS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tap and hold the “+” button, and select “Transcribe…”. You will be prompted to select an audio or video file.</li>
<li>Share any audio or video file from other apps, including Files and Voice Memos, to Drafts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mac</strong>
<ul>
<li>Select <code>File &gt; Import...</code> from the main menu, and choose and audio or video file.</li>
<li>Drag and drop an audio or video file on the Drafts app icon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you plan to use this transcription, please <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/transcription">read the full documentation</a> to understand its capabilities and limitations.</em></p>

<a name="extract-text-from-pdfs-4" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#extract-text-from-pdfs-4"></a>Extract Text from PDFs</h3>
<p>If you attempt to open a PDF file in Drafts, you will now be offered the option to extract text from the PDF into a new Drafts.</p>
<p>To try it out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>iOS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tap and hold the “+” button, and select “Import File…”. Select any PDF file.</li>
<li>Share any PDF file from other apps, including Files, to Drafts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mac</strong>
<ul>
<li>Select <code>File &gt; Import...</code> from the main menu, and choose a PDF file.</li>
<li>Drag and drop a PDF file on the Drafts app icon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Extraction will only grab actual text content from the PDF. Some PDF files have embedded image content and will not work with this feature.</p>

<h4>
<a name="other-changes-and-updates-5" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#other-changes-and-updates-5"></a>Other Changes and Updates</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Change:</strong> Replaced microphone icon on Apple Watch complications and buttons. Since Apple has made it so it is not possible to launch input directly to dictation on watchOS 8.1, it no longer makes sense to use microphone icon. (<em>PS: Please let Apple know if you do not like this change! We’d love to get back the ability to go straight to dictation.</em>)</li>
<li>
<strong>Change:</strong> Change sort order of trash to use accessed date/descending to make it easier to find and restore items recently added to the trash.</li>
<li>
<strong>Change:</strong> <code>[[line]]</code> template tag when used with specifying a line argument, now returns the text of the current selection extended to the beginning and end of the lines. Useful for grabbing the current line text in an action without needing to select the text first.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fix (iOS):</strong> Issues sorting actions upwards in the action list.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fix:</strong> Issue appending to files in Bookmark folders from different devices.</li>
<li>A variety of performance improvements and fixed for visual glitches.</li>

          <title>&quot;Things for Things&quot; - an Action Group for Things</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[tommertron]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Actions - Share What You&#39;ve Made</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m really proud to share the Action group I made to add your drafts to things. This is a group that I’ve personally been using and refining for about a year now.</p>
<p>I’ve been disappointed in the past with script-heavy Things actions that rely on parsing your draft for due dates, projects, etc, and usually require you to use very specific syntax. This group has none of that. This is focused on taking the content of your draft and quickly putting it into a place in Things. Need to do this thing today? Just hit the “Today” action. Need to do on a specific date? Choose “Pick a Date,” and type when it needs to be done.</p>
<p>This is very tailored to how I use Things. For instance, there’s an “Add to Work” action and an “Add to House” action that assumes you have those projects or areas in Things. If you don’t, your to-do will simply land in the inbox. Those are really meant to be customized to choose the projects or areas you add things to the most.</p>
<p>The “Pick a Project” action is the most complicated one, and assumes you have a Draft with a list of projects that matches that of things. This was super tricky for me to build, and I relied a lot of the Drafts community to help making it. Thank you!</p>
<p>Anyway, hope some Drafts/Things users find this one useful.</p>

          <title>RFC: Syntax Definition Format</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <blockquote>
<p><strong>Request for Comment</strong>: Interested in custom syntaxes in Drafts? Please read below. Would love feedback on the format before it is finalized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drafts’ editor supports multiple syntax highlighting options (Like Markdown, Taskpaper, etc.). Currently, only the syntaxes that ship with Drafts are available, but later this year we plan to make a feature available to allow users to create, install and share custom syntax definitions.</p>
<p>This will allow creation of additional options for popular formats not currently supported in Drafts, but also customization of and variations to common formats to support special features, or work with custom themes in different ways. And, yes, custom themes will come along with syntax definitions…details forthcoming.</p>
<p>I have published <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extending/syntax-definitions/syntax-definitions">preliminary syntax definition documentation</a> and would love it people interested in creating custom syntaxes would look it over, ask questions, make suggestions. If there are modifications or improvements needed to the format and related functionality, it will be a lot easier to make before finalizing a format.</p>
<p>Read: <strong><a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extending/syntax-definitions/syntax-definitions.html">Preliminary Syntax Definition Format Documentation</a></strong></p>
<p>If you have specific ideas for things you’d like to do with custom syntaxes, please bring them up as well. I’m interested to be sure as many options as possible can be supported by the format.</p>
<p>More docs on themes and how syntaxes and themes work together to create the final appearance of text in the editor will be forthcoming as well.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>N. Richland Hills, Texas</strong>: Today, Drafts, an iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch app, celebrates ten years of availability in the Apple App Store and offers new customers the chance to sign up for a special introductory offer.</p>
<p>Regularly featured by Apple and the App Store, Drafts is a stalwart of the Apple ecosystem and has pride of place on countless Home screens around the world. Drafts has undergone many changes over those ten years, but its focus remains on making it as quick and easy to capture thoughts as possible. To that end, Drafts opens to a blank page, ready for text to be typed.</p>
<p>In the decade since its debut, Drafts has become <em>the</em> place where people put their ideas, notes, shopping lists, and more. No matter where that text might end up, it starts in Drafts. From there, Drafts’ note sorting and management features can be used to organize thoughts or text can be sent to other apps and web services for processing. Whether it’s a message to be sent via the Messages app or something as powerful as publishing a blog post, Drafts captures the text and sends it where it needs to be — and fast!</p>
<p>Ten years in the App Store has helped Drafts grow a community of users of all levels who are ready to help people as they get started. A growing directory of actions couples with a community always eager to help makes Drafts the perfect way to do almost anything with words.</p>
<p>When speed is of the essence, Drafts is the perfect place to capture everything whether people are following the Getting Things Done methodology or just want to note those shower thoughts before they pass. Robby, an educator, author, podcaster, and percussionist has been using Drafts for every one of those ten years and enjoys the way Drafts is always there, ready to capture thoughts that can be processed later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the many professional domains I juggle, my job as a middle school band director alone requires me to manage a lot of responsibility. I have to be a master teacher, performer, arranger, composer, conductor, data clerk, fundraiser, field trip planner, and more. Being able to tap the Drafts icon on my dock and quickly enter any thought that enters into my mind has been nothing short of life-changing. I used to be overwhelmed by my responsibilities, but through organization systems, and particularly Drafts, I have been able to take away the friction between the thoughts that grab my attention and what gets permanently saved in a computer. Drafts turns my devices into a second brain, and my rampant thoughts fade out of sight, out of mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using all of the latest Apple technologies and by leveraging the power of iCloud, everything Drafts captures is quickly and automatically synced to all your devices. The ultimate quick-capture device, Apple Watch supports voice input and more.</p>
<p>To celebrate ten years of Drafts and to help people see how it can help them, developer Agile Tortoise is offering the first year of Drafts Pro for just $4.99 — a notable saving on the normal $19.99 subscription. This offer is available to new customers and will run from today through April 30, 2022. To claim the offer, users should visit <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com">getdrafts.com/offers</a></p>
<p>As part of the celebration, Agile Tortoise is also opening a Drafts Store with branded t-shirts and other merchandise. The Drafts Store can be found at <a href="http://getdrafts.com/store">getdrafts.com/store</a>.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The short version is that I like the idea of bullet journals, but in practice I’d much rather log things in my phone or watch than with a pen and paper. I also want the things I’ve written to automatically go to my calendar and task manager, instead of having to sit down with a paper journal and manually transcribe them.</p>
<p>This action group lets me easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Today’s Journal</li>
<li>Append the current draft to Today’s Journal</li>
<li>Process journal events and send them to Fantastical, OmniFocus, and Day One</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope someone else finds this to be useful!</p>
