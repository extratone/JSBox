            <p>Is there a way to select which Gmail account a Drafts email action opens?<br>
I am usually logged into two gmail accounts, one personal and one for business. But when I compose a message and click the email action it opens a new email draft in Gmail but it’s not even clear which account it is, and no way to change.<br>
Is this possible?<br>
Thanks!</p>

            <p>I have been using Drafts on my Mac for quite some time with no issue.</p>
<p>Suddenly today the Action Bar at the bottom of my Mac only shows items fro Markdown; even if select a different Action group on the right side of the interface, the Action Bar does not change.  Why might this be?</p>

            <p>I’m trying to modify <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1yz" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Spark Mailer v2</a> to use the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6068" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">mailto URL scheme</a> instead of the <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/which-ios-email-apps-support-automation-shortcuts-url-schemes-x-callback-url/3552/9" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Spark URL Scheme</a>.  The reason for making the conversion is that apparently using mailto allows &lt;newline&gt; characters embedded into the &lt;body&gt; whereas they are ignored using the Spark (and perhaps all other email) URL Schemes.  (<a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/need-spark-action-that-sends-copies/12486/21">Details here</a>.)</p>
<p>Here’s the test code I’m using:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">// Test data - Remove
let strNicknameList = "nicknameList"
let strEmailTo = "nameTo1&lt;acctTo1@domain.tld&gt;"
let strEmailCc = "nameCC1&lt;acctCC1@domain.tld&gt;"
let strEmailBcc = "nameBCC1&lt;acctBCC1@domain.tld&gt;"
let strPageTitle = "pageTitle";
let strPageURL = "pageURL";
let strPageSelection = "pageSelection";


// Build and call the mailto URL
// Use the callback object to make adding parameters easier ... but *NOT* running as a call back.
// Base settings
let cburlMailto = CallbackURL.create();
cburlMailto.waitForResponse = false;
cburlMailto.baseURL = "mailto:" + strEmailTo;
// Who else gets it
if (strEmailCc != "") cburlMailto.addParameter("cc", strEmailCc);
if (strEmailBcc != "") cburlMailto.addParameter("bcc", strEmailBcc);
// Subject line
cburlMailto.addParameter("subject", strPageTitle);
// Body
cburlMailto.addParameter("body",`${strNicknameList}

${strPageURL}


${strPageSelection}`);

// Log Url string - Remove
console.log("cburlMailto: " + cburlMailto());

// Open default mailer
cburlMailto.open();
</code></pre>
<p>My problem is trying to display the string built in <code>cburlMailto</code>.</p>
<p>How do I log it on the console or display it in an alert?</p>

<p>I have a question about actions that I can’t find the answer to, and I’m hoping someone can assist.</p>
<p>I have found the Drafts to Fantastical action and that works brilliantly. I type a Draft, send it to Fantastical and it appears. No issues there.</p>
<p>It is possible for me to type a list of dates within a single Draft and to send them to Fantastical and create a number of different events? When I do that at the moment, it creates a “proposal” of a single event with a number of different possible times/dates rather than multiple events, which is what I am after.</p>
<p>Any guidance gratefully received.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

          <title>Setting different fonts for different notes?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve spent the morning confusing myself about fonts. I’d like to have one note in a mono font, and use System for everything else. Is this possible?</p>
<p>So far, I have a couple of notes display in Menlo, the rest in System, but I’m not sure why. It seems to be a mix of Markdown vs MultiMarkdown and Font in Preferences, but I’m not sure which settings are sticky across notes and which are only for the current note. Any help appreciated.</p>

          <title>How to create a templates note from iOS shortcut</title>

            <p>I create a daily email on iPad.<br>
I use an iOS shortcut to open my emailing service, Deezer music, and create a blank note in Drafts.<br>
Then I run a Drafts action to get title, content, signatures, etc. automatically added in the blank note.<br>
So I am ready to write my content.</p>
<p>How to get this action running from the iOS shortcut, so that I would not need to run it manually after blank note creation.</p>
<p>Any other implementation would be fine.<br>
Any idea ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

          <title>Evaluate Template Tags in Current Draft</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Isshin]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I would like to evaluate placeholder template tags in an already existing Draft and update the draft in-place, without having to create a new document from a template. I’m basically code illiterate. I have, in the past, managed to modify some existing scripts to meet my needs, but I seem to be completely stuck on the fundamentals here.</p>
<p>Basically, I want to grab anything in the current Draft that uses the template tags like <code>[[date]]</code> or <code>&lt;&lt;TextExpander_snippet&gt;&gt;</code> and replace that placeholder with appropriate information. I’m okay with either just grabbing the current line or evaluating the draft as a whole. I thought it would be simpler to process the Draft as a whole instead of trying to get tricky with selectors, but I’m not even having luck there.</p>
<p>Based on my extremely limited understanding of scripting syntax I thought something like this would work: <code>let updated_text = processTemplate(draft.content);</code></p>
<p>Edit:<br>
This works for tags like <code>[[date]]</code></p>
<p><code>draft.content = draft.processTemplate("[[draft]]”);</code><br>
<code>draft.update();</code></p>
<p>but TextExpander shortcuts like <code>&lt;&lt;ldate&gt;&gt;</code> do not work even though typing the abbreviation <code>ldate</code> into Drafts manually <em>does</em> expand as expected.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to take the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18j">New Linked Draft</a> action a step further:</p>
<p>I would like to add an action to the script when it executes so the the new draft created includes more than just the [[title]].</p>
<p>I believe I am dealing with this portion of the script:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	// create the new linked draft
	let d = Draft.create();
	d.content = p.fieldValues["title"];
	d.content = d.processTemplate(template);
	let tags = p.fieldValues["tags"].split(",").map(s =&gt; s.trim());
	for (let tag of tags) {
		d.addTag(tag);
	} 
	d.update();
</code></pre>
<p>Many thanks for your guidance.</p>

            <p>Hi All, been reading through Tags and Templates documentation but cannot seem to find the answer on this.</p>
<p>Is it possible to import the content of a linked draft [[Draft Name]]?</p>
<p>Usecase:<br>
I started a new job and need to compile emails to clients after we met with them, we discuss various topics with them, but not all the same. I would like to have like a reference list of topics (pre-compiled drafts) and then start email in Drafts and add the references to the topics so they are then imported into the email when running the action?</p>
<p>Example Draft Email:</p>
<p>Hello<br>
Thank you for the time during the review session, as discussed we would like to provide you with some links and information about the topics we discussed.</p>
<p>[[Draft 1]]</p>
<p>[[Draft 2]]</p>
<p>Thanks, hope that makes sense.</p>

            <p>I have lines of text in a plain text document with “fields” separated by spaces or tabs. (I don’t have the ability to convert this to, say, a CSV file because the separation of the “fields” using tabs or spaces is not consistent, unfortunately.) I’d like to highlight certain “fields” or in some cases all items after the first for deletion. I could do this if I could highlight text in columns, rather than lines. Is something like this even possible in Draft.</p>
<p>Any thoughts would be most appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<a name="action-bar-tint-colors-3" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#action-bar-tint-colors-3"></a>Action Bar Tint Colors</h3>
<p>For those who are fond of using color to distinguish items on screen, there is now an option to use action tint colors in the <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/action-bar">Action Bar</a>. To enable on iOS, scroll to Action Bar options in <code>Aa</code> editor settings. On Mac, toggle menu item in Action Bar’s group selection drop-down menu.</p>

<a name="date-math-travel-in-time-sort-of-4" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#date-math-travel-in-time-sort-of-4"></a>Date Math - Travel in Time, Sort of…</h3>
<p>It is sometimes useful to output a date that is relative to another date (usually the current one), adjusted by some time interval. It has always been possible in script to create and adjust future and past dates, but now it is easier with the addition of a new method to adjust dates using simple date math expressions.</p>
<p>This begins with a new way to create related date expressions, which consist of a list of plus or minus time intervals which can applied to a date. Each expression look like <code>(+|-)(integer) (unit)</code>, and can be combined in a list to make multiple adjustments to a date. A couple of quick examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>+1 year</code> : Add one year to the date.</li>
<li>
<code>-2 months -6 hours</code>: Subtract two months and six hours from date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Units supported are: year, month, day, hour, minute, second. Units can be used in either singular or plural forms.</p>
<p>These expressions can be used in JavaScripts with the <a href="https://scripting.getdrafts.com/globals#adjustdate"><code>adjustDate(date, expression)</code> function</a>, or by providing an additional expression argument, along with the strftime formatting argument, in template tags which work with date. Those tags are the <code>[[date]]</code>, <code>[[time]]</code>, <code>[[created]]</code>, and <code>[[modified]]</code> tags. Again, by example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>[[date|+1 year|%Y-%m-%d]]</code>: Current date next year. So, on May 1, 2022, this would output: 2023-05-01.</li>
<li>
<code>[[created|-1 month|%Y-%m-%d]]</code>: Output a month before the creation date of the draft.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjustment expressions are calendar-aware, such that adding 1 month to May 31 would result in June 30, since June does not have a 31st.</p>
<p>A couple of ready to use examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1z3">Insert Tomorrow</a>: Action which inserts tomorrow’s date at the cursor location in the editor.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com">Date: Tomorrow Autocomplete Suggestion</a>: Install a <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/autocomplete#global-autocomplete-suggestions">global autocomplete suggestion</a> which inserts tomorrow’s date.</li>

<a name="mustache-templates-5" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#mustache-templates-5"></a>Mustache Templates</h3>
<p>Drafts templates, with their square-bracket, <code>[[title]]</code>-style tags are still the default throughout actions, but with this update we have introduced the option to use an alternate template engine based on Mustache templates.</p>
<p>Mustache templates provide some additional power, like the ability to have conditionally rendered blocks, loop over arrays, insert information from other drafts, as well as more powerful filtering options. For details, <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates/mustache">see the Mustache documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Mustache templates are available as a option on all long-form templates in action steps, can can also be triggered via script using the <a href="https://scripting.getdrafts.com/classes/draft#processmustachetemplate"><code>draft.processMustacheTemplate</code> function</a>.</p>

<p>If you often capture using the share extension and Safari, you might be interested in switching your <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/share#web-capture-template">web capture template</a> to use Mustache. This has the advantage of being able to use conditional sections to only render part of the text template for the captured text selection <em>if</em> a selection exists.</p>
<h3>
<a name="improved-template-editing-7" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#improved-template-editing-7"></a>Improved Template Editing</h3>
<p>Drafts now includes basic syntax hightlighting definitions for both Drafts templates, and the new Mustache templates. When editing long-form templates in actions steps, the templates can now (optionally) be opened in an editor with syntax highlighting and basic autocomplete for common tags. Use the edit button by the template in the action editor to open the template editor.</p>

          <title>Tinting of Action Bar label characters too?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[suavito]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Feature Requests</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>First of all, the new tinting of icons in the Action Bar is great! The recognisability of darker grey icons on a the lighter grey is not good, especially on a small screen like the iPhone’s. A vibrant color instead of grey makes a major improvement in usability.</p>
<p>That said, even just grey the icons were by far more recognisable than label chacracters because they are bigger and bolder.</p>
<p>So my question is if it is possible to introduce tinting and bolding for label characters too. And maybe a size adjustment to make them look more coherent with the icons. Of course this only makes sense for single or very few characters to not expand their width too much.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to expand the icon set: With all punctuation including various kinds of brackets, and at best a set of characters. (Which of course leads to the question: What kind of characters? Only Latin? Latin with extras like cedillas? And what about users not writing in Latin? An icon set containing characters would be a technically simple solution but might easily lead to either a very, very huge—huge as in: Unicode sized—icon set  or a disadvantaged user group.)</p>

            <p>Is it possible to use Add to List and have the list not include the precursor - [  ] ??</p>
<p>Background:<br>
I use Add to List for several quick and simple Journals - they are ‘one-liners’ that include a date, a keyword and short text. Here is a typical entry “05/03 Home - Completed side yard tool shed”  I found I have to go through several steps to backup/save a month’s posting to a spreadsheet that simply has 3 columns for Date | Keyword | Text. I do this by using ‘Text to Columns’  to separate entries into columns.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy list to a spreadsheet</li>
<li>Use Text to column to remove ‘-’</li>
<li>Use Text to column to remove ‘[  ]’</li>
<li>Text to Column to remove ‘-’</li>
</ol>
<p>I can simplify the monthly task now by using a) and Action that provides Date*. I then add Keyword* (space) and post. I still have several steps to remove - [  ] …</p>
<p>Thanks, Bob</p>

          <title>The best way to deal with app registration numbers etc</title>

          <category>General Discussion</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This is probably a bit of a weird question but I’ve been struggling with something and maybe someone here has an idea that could help.</p>
<p>Over the years I have purchased many programs. These programs usually come with a registration code. I moved them all into Evernote into a notebook called registrations. This was easily searched and was something that I came to depend upon more than I thought I would.</p>
<p>However, Evernote has very much gone downhill over the last period of time. I switched from it to Obsidian, and now use the Drafts app quite a bit to write in.</p>
<p>But I’m still not really sure where to put all these registrations. I did export them out of Evernote and I can easily bring them into Drafts or Obsidian.</p>
<p>The thing is, they will never serve any purpose that Obsidian does, like note making. So what the heck do I do with them?</p>
<p>One thought is that I could put them in Drafts, in a workspace just for them.</p>
<p>Another thing I could do is probably put them in obsidian in a folder that I don’t include in links or searches other than if I specifically want to search that folder. I think that’s possible. It does not seem very elegant to me but it does seem possible.</p>
<p>Yet another thing I could do is probably input these, one by one in 1Password.</p>
<p>If you have any ideas on these lines, I would sure appreciate suggestions. I’ve spent way too much time trying to figure this out and I’ve got nowhere. So I figured maybe someone here has figured out a solution that would help me as well.</p>

<p>Copy and paste is one way but it seems like it is less than what I wish it would be. Is there another way?</p>

          <title>One software lie ... [[GTD-ness]]</title>

            <p>Software features often are a lie… let me elaborate on that.</p>

WARNING! <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/one-software-lie-gtd-ness/12570/1">(click for more details)</a>
<p>It has been over twenty year since I read the GTD-book by David Allen. Sadly David himself was using and utilizing Lotus Notes during his first decades of work life and therefore lived completely in his own world without generating a official GTD software.<br>
Up to my knowledege he still is hesitant to state on those claims to GTD made from many software and keeps repeating in his book about the core feature “List Managers”.</p>
<p>But hence name dropping is cool - as I am guilty myself of many times - and GTD is hip, nearly every task manager claims to be GTD. I mean in a sense they are because GTD is the short form for “getting things done” and a task manager helps you getting things done - right?</p>
<p>But GTD in David Allen’s definition is more. A toolset of good and simply ideas combined to a powerful system. The 2 minute rule for example is a very interesting concept that I try to teach my children in any context - I even make a 5 min rule out of it.</p>

what is the 2-minute-rule <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/one-software-lie-gtd-ness/12570/1">(click for more details)</a>
<blockquote>
<p>So does every GTD-stating task-manager not implementing the two minute rule lie?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GTD as the GTD-system is a very great definition of how to organize tasks and projects and not get lost in the daily and weekly walk with them.</p>
<p>David states this as his “trusted system”. And the quest for a trusted system is often a very hard and long one. Interestingly I found <code>Things</code> on iOS to be a very good (in a sense of OK) system - but this only since i totally wracked their implementation of objects - more about that later.</p>
<p>As a software-engineer working in a team and a love to definition and philosophy I found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software is sum of the frozen thoughts of a/the developer(s)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore it is not <em>the</em> way of implementing it but <em>a</em> way. And if your way of thinking matches up with the way of thinking of the developer you can use the software. If not you might be able to bend your thoughts into the software or (sometimes) bend the software to your way of thinking.</p>
<p>Lets do an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>GTD defines <em>tasks</em> that you need to do</li>
<li>GTD sorts that tasks inside of <em>contexts</em> to do them in batches and to filter them if the context does not apply</li>
<li>GTD defines a task as a step in a <em>project</em> - something not get to a goal or outcome by more than one step</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to the implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things defines <em>tasks</em> and sorts them in <em>projects</em> - <em>nice and good</em>
</li>
<li>Things defines <em>tags</em> to be maybe used as <em>contexts</em>
</li>
<li>Things does not give a simple or top-level way to <strong>access those contexts</strong>
</li>
<li>But it gives you many layers to set start and due dates - <em>nothing a task in GTD is mentioned to have</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you stop and think a moment about GTD and your daily needs this sorting of Things is kind of strange.<br>
To put things inside a project is a logical step.<br>
But not to put them in context that will help you daily access it later is quite against GTD that I only can shake my head about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So even Things - one software that I trust to be my GTD-system - has pitfalls as deep and wide as that basic GTD-concept.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So what did I do to continue using Things?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I sort my tasks in Things in contexts (formerly known as Things projects - but now never used as such from me inside my contexts areas)</li>
<li>I also create projects (from projects) and put reference information, ideas and goals into them and review them regularly</li>
<li>but my tasks in the contexts are not connected to the projects in my project and someday maybe lists</li>
</ul>

Is this a problem? <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/one-software-lie-gtd-ness/12570/1">(click for more details)</a>
<p>A complete different trail is the difference between tasks (actionable things) and ideas.<br>
But this will not be part of this topic.</p>
<p><strong>So my (kind of harsh) statement is that software (or the developers) are lying about there GTD-ness of software. Or even replace the feature of GTD with other aspects. (e.g. Zettelkasten…)</strong></p>
<p>I would love to read your opinion on this…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you find the holy grail of GTD-software?<br>
Did you have similar moment of - what am I doing?</p>

            <p>Hi there! I am considering moving to NotePlan 3 as my Task Management system, since I am a Setapp subscriber. There are a couple of NotePlan actions and action groups in the directory, however I can’t find any action that will take a list of items and turn them into separate tasks in NotePlan. Does anybody have any suggestion on how to accomplish this? Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,<br>
I want to add a date to the end of <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com">this action</a>.</p>
<p>But when insert the date it is rewriting the entire draft  because a prior step “selected all text” to copy it…</p>
<p>How can I add a step / script to deselect all… move the cursor to the end of the Draft?</p>
<p>I can add the date from there…<br>
Many thanks.</p>

I’m wondering, is there any built-in feature / action which can show last recent X notes opened?<br>
Used that heavily with my previous notes app and haven’t found how to do that with Drafts.</p>

            <p>I have a large list of tags that I wrote in both Agenda and Upnote apps that I would like to transfer to Drafts. Is it possible to do a batch import of tags? If yes, can you point me the way?</p>
<p>I was able to copy them into a draft with the hashtags. However, what I want to do is to be able to just copy and paste them into “tags” so that I have all the tags available in Drafts without having to reenter them one at a time.</p>
<p>Thanks for your tips!</p>

          <title>Accessing the Clipboard from Javascript</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bws950]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Actions - Help &amp; Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have an action set up that lets me create a document that (in relevant part) includes a Bible passage obtained through an online API and pastes it into a broader template.  I’m using the Insert ESV Text action from the Drafts Directory (<a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1SM" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>) to obtain a different passage each day; that action is set up, using Javascript, to provide a prompt to the user asking for the relevant passage, which it then submits to the API, ultimately returning the text of the passage.</p>
<p>I’d like to modify the action so that rather than prompting me for the relevant passage, it instead pulls the passage from the clipboard (i.e., the clipboard would already contain the text that I’d otherwise type into the prompt, and would just run automatically without requiring any interaction from the user).  I’m almost completely Javascript-illiterate, though, and haven’t been able to figure out how to access the clipboard from within the script or to set a variable to the clipboard.  (I’ve pasted the the script below; I <em>think</em> that what I need to do is set the “passage” variable to be the clipboard.)</p>
<p>Is there a way to accomplish that using javascript?  (I tried defining a Template tag in Drafts and then using that template tag within the Script step of my action, but that did not work.)  Thanks very much in advance for any help!</p>
