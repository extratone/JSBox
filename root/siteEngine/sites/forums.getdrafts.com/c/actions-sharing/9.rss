            <p>I use MailMate on Mac and Airmail on iOS, and often copy links to emails. I made this action to quickly convert links back and forth so I can easily open messages from any platform. This action works on the selected text and replaces it with the alternate link; it should be safe to use on random text since it will not change it.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This morning I had a bunch of email addresses to clean up. I was surprised not to find an action for this in Draft, so I thought I’d quickly make one. The action takes the selected text as input, matches all email addresses (regex from <a href="https://www.emailregex.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.emailregex.com</a>), and stores a comma-separated list in the clipboard, including only the email addresses.</p>
<p>I hope it’s helpful to someone else <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

          <title>On My Mind Action Group</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[FlohGro]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Actions - Share What You&#39;ve Made</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was intrigued by <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">viticci</a>’s Workflow with his “On My Mind” Shortcut to simplify ‘Thought Capture’ he shared recently in the MacStories Weekly.</p>
<p>Since I don’t use obsidian and heavily rely on Drafts as my main input tool I built an Action Group for the same purpose to use with Drafts which I want to share with you <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/sunglasses.png?v=12" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>It contains actions to add thoughts to your “On My Mind” Draft based on your input in a Prompt or the content of the current Draft.<br>
You can quickly open your “On My Mind” Draft from anywhere and when you’re ready to process the chunks of text in it you can run the ‘process On My Mind Action’</p>
<p>You can customize the processing options to your own needs. This will allow you to run any of your own Actions from a Prompt on each chunk of text in the “On My Mind” Draft just like you would on normal Drafts.</p>
<p>You can e.g. send one chunk of text as task to your Task Manager and the next one to Craft to create a new note or use one of my Append/Prepend Actions to existing documents. Or just run any other Action you’re using on a regular basis.</p>
<p>You can download the Action Group from the <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/g/1yM">Drafts directory</a></p>
<p>To show you how to use it and how to configure your own Actions I recorded a Video which you can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/KmqErC3O4Yc">on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>I hope these Actions are useful for you! If you have any issues or other ideas just let me know <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/v/3.png?v=12" title=":v:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":v:t3:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>If you’re like me and you use Drafts for writing blog posts and you have an SSG or other system that makes use of GitHub actions to pull in updates and recompile your site, you might enjoy this demonstration of a shortcut of mine. I use Working Copy to handle getting the post and any images into the repo, commit and push, and make sure any other branches in the repo get updated as well.</p>
<p>There’s also a demonstration of my Drafts Post Photo shortcut that lets me pick and choose images, puts a copy in the Drafts images preview folder, and inserts the markdown in the draft for me.</p>

<p>Howdy folks! After discovering that Drafts includes <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#webdav" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">a WebDAV service</a> a few days ago, I’ve been toying around with my first attempt at Action development from scratch. I’ve long fantasized about a more direct way to interact with my NeoCities site(s) - (NeoCities supports WebDAV as its exclusive means of remote file management.)    The end goal for the Action Group would be to utilize Drafts’ WebDAV support to its absolute fullest extent to interact with/manage files on a web server over WebDAV.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve been able to push drafts to the server successfully but only when titled by UUID or Timestamp. (<code>[[uuid]].html/[[time]].html</code>)  When I try to use <code>[[title]]</code> or <code>[[display_title]]</code>, the resulting path is unreadable for some reason.</p>
<p>Anywho, I thought I’d open a thread here. Any suggestions/tips from those of you with more experience developing actions are more than welcome!</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1uF" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the (unlisted) Action Directory link</a> for those with the time/curiosity to check on my progress.</p>

          <title>Cross linking a project between todoist and craft</title>

            <p>this action is only useful for Todoist and Craft users. It could maybe be adapted for other Task managers or note apps (totally possible with Drafts itself) but I haven’t looked into this deeper.</p>
<p>I developed an action which is really useful when you often create project documents in Craft and would like to link them to a corresponding project in todoist</p>
<p>It prompts you for a title of the project and then creates the new project in todoist and a new document in Craft (based on a template) which are linked to each other.</p>
<p>The Drafts action can be downloaded here: <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1sk" class="inline-onebox">create crosslinked project in Craft and Todoist | Drafts Directory</a></p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have made a series of actions that allow me to add custom tags and to preview them with a custom css class.</p>
<p>I have this currently working only for my workflow, but since is something hard to find, let me know if more of you are interested in something like this, so I can modify my version to be more widely apealing</p>
<h2>
<a name="example-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#example-1"></a>Example</h2>
<p>In the following line, the custom tag is <code>¨m  ¨</code> and has the class name “<strong>motion</strong>”, and with the styles it sets the text to <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">¨m Any Text ¨
</code></pre>
<p>So the complete text beeing like</p>
<hr>
<p># Title</p>
<p>This is a line ¨m with a custom tag ¨</p>
<p>- This is a list item</p>
<hr>
<p>While end up looking like this</p>
<hr>
<h1>
<a name="title-2" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#title-2"></a>Title</h1>
<p>This is a line <strong><em>with a custom tag</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a list item</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The tags could be set to anything if you know how to find it in Regex, or with a simple in and out descriptor.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I just made an action that allows me to create multiple drafts with a predefined template from a single action.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1rc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Action</a></p>
<p>In the current draft you can only use the action in the draft that is the template, but you can easily modify it to prompt you for a template to choose or anything.</p>
<p>I use it by calling it from other actions, so that suits me very well. Hope it can help some of you be more productive</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, I’ve made an action to move the selected lines up or down, you can download the main action <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>But you will also need this two actions <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com">Move Line Up</a> and <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com">Move Line Down</a>.</p>
<p>You need them beacause the main action just receives the lines you want to swap.</p>
<p><strong>Hope this helps</strong></p>
<h2>
<a name="for-modifications-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#for-modifications-1"></a>For modifications</h2>
<p>If you want to modify this action theres only one drawback, in my script you can only swap lines that are adjacent. I made it this way because it was easier to check for errors.</p>
<p>It can be modified to swap any two lines in the editor, you just need to make sure to check for cases in witch the text will be moved inside the other range. That caused problems for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you want to call the action with your own action in requires a <code>templateTag</code> named <code>’swap-lines’</code> that need to contain the index and range of both of the full lines you want to swap encoded in the following way:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">“4-5,9-3”
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>4-5</code> means the second line starts in index <code>4</code> and has a length of <code>5</code> and the next line starts at index <code>9</code> with a length of <code>3</code></p>
<h3>
<a name="keep-selection-2" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#keep-selection-2"></a>Keep Selection</h3>
<p>This action keeps the same text selected when you swap to adjacent lines, it does that by receiving the selected line in the first parameter.</p>
<p>If you want to swap two lines and non of them are selected, you would need to modify the selection process</p>

            <p>I have been creating a bunch of routines in OmniFocus that require me to run a shortcut. To make that easier, I have been using URLs in my OmniFocus notes to kick these off, but I have had to build the URL by hand.</p>
<p>I made a simple one-step action to take the contents of the draft, URL encode it, and prefix it with the shortcuts URL scheme. Check it out here:</p>

          <title>&quot;Edit Markdown Table&quot; Example Action</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I wrote an example action which rolls the excelling <a href="https://github.com/stevecat/table-magic">Table Magic</a> web-based Markdown table editor into a Drafts HTML Preview-based action.</p>
<p>This action allows you to build and insert, or edit a selected, Markdown table using web-based tools which support preview, editing Markdown directly, or editing in a spreadsheet-style table editor.</p>
<p>If you cancel in the dialog, your changes are discarded. If you “Save Changes”, the updated table is inserted in the editor.</p>
<p>See video for demonstration:</p>

<p>This action likely has some room for improvement, if people have suggestions for tweaking it.</p>
<p>Get the example action from the Directory:</p>

          <title>Send to Obsidian w/ YAML metadata</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Send a draft to Obsidian as a new note with YAML metadata as front matter. The tags, title, and creation date metadata from the draft are carried over to the Obsidian note as front matter. The text of the Draft remains unaltered by this action. The new note appears in the specified Obsidian vault where its vault settings specify new notes go. (Top level by default)</p>
<p>If using iCloud syncing for Drafts and Obsidian, this action works seamlessly across Mac OS and iOS.</p>
<p>Not tested on any older versions than Drafts 27.0.11, Mac OS 11.4, Obsidian 0.12.12 on the desktop and Drafts 27.1, iOS 14.7.1, and Obsidian 1.0.4 on devices.</p>
<p>This has deep origins in a send to Ulysses action, albeit several generations ago. The most recent action which inspired this was from Olivier Spinnler (<a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/olivierps">@OlivierPS</a>)</p>
<p>Some other YAML metadata keys are provided. The YAML keys used here are what I thought would be reasonable meta data for a document, ala PDF or Word. Your needs and mileage may vary. I tried to structure things such that code neophytes can modify this to their liking without too much trouble.</p>

            <p>Trying to see if there’s any interest? Take a look at the GIF below but effectively, I’m making Markdown tables easier to read while editing. I have more table functions coming as well (such as tab to next cell).</p>
<p>I’m still sorting out a couple of edge cases so it’s not quite ready to share. Happy to get feedback!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this works best if the syntax you’re using makes table render in monospace</p>

          <title>Insert Date with a Prompt</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[_heyjarrod]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Actions - Share What You&#39;ve Made</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I created my first scripting action today! It was also the first time I’ve ever tried to learn/use javascript, and I’m far more proud of it than is warranted.</p>
<p>My goal was to create a prompt that would allow me to choose from several formats to insert the current date into my current draft. I started with the Prompt action, but couldn’t understand how to take the output of the prompt and change it into anything useful. All I could get out of the prompt was the text that made up the button I pressed.</p>
<p>So…I went down the (admittedly) much harder route and tried to figure out how to use a script to display a prompt and do what I wanted. It took a while, and with much referencing the example actions in the Directory, the Draft Script Reference, and this very forum.</p>
<p>Here’s the result: <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1o3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Insert Date (Prompt)</a>. And <a href="https://dsh.re/8d64e" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here’s a screencast</a> of it working using a keyboard command.</p>
<p>And here’s the script. It’s my first one, so I have a lot to learn. If anyone has suggestions on how to streamline the code, I’d love to learn. As Dani Rojas says in Ted Lasso, “Roast me, amigo!”</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
// # Insert a formatted date in Drafts.app using a prompt.

// Store selection
const [st, len] = editor.getSelectedRange();

// Create prompt
var p = Prompt.create();

p.title = "Insert Formatted Date";

// Arrange the buttons in the order in which you prefer. The top button will be highlighted by default and can be selected by pressing the 'Return' key when prompted.
p.addButton("yyyy-mm-dd");
p.addButton("Month d, yyyy");
p.addButton("mm/dd/yyyy");
p.addButton("mm-dd-yyyy");
p.addButton("mm/d/yy");
p.addButton("mm-d-yy");

// Show prompt
p.show();

var b = (p.buttonPressed)

var ymd = draft.processTemplate("2021-07-18")
var mdy = draft.processTemplate("[[date|%B %e, %Y]]")

// Process dates based on button selection and set variable for the processed date (pd).
if (b == "yyyy-mm-dd") {
	var pd = draft.processTemplate("2021-07-18")
	}
if (b == "Month d, yyyy") {
	var pd = draft.processTemplate("[[date|%B %e, %Y]]")
	}
if (b == "mm/dd/yyyy") {
	var pd = draft.processTemplate("[[date|%m/%d/%Y]]")
	}
if (b == "mm-dd-yyyy") {
	var pd = draft.processTemplate("[[date|%m-%d-%Y]]")
	}
if (b == "mm/d/yy") {
	var pd = draft.processTemplate("[[date|%m/%e/%y]]")
	}
if (b == "mm-d-yy") {
	var pd = draft.processTemplate("[[date|%m-%e-%y]]")
	}

// Take action
if (pd != undefined) {
	// Insert processed date template into the draft at the selected range or point
	editor.setTextInRange(st, len, pd);
	// Reactivate the editor with the insertion point at the end of the newly added date
	editor.setSelectedRange(st + pd.length, 0);
}

editor.activate();

          <title>Send to Obsidian — with tags and YAML metadata</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve just added an improved version of a “Send to Obsidian” action. The improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The note’s name is either the heading or  the creation date-time, depending on the drafts beginning with a header or not.</li>
<li>A YAML header is added with the creation date and time of the draft.</li>
<li>The tags are written at the end of the note, under a separator line.</li>
<li>The vault name is an editable constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you start your draft with a <code>#</code>, it implies that the first line is a header — it doesn’t matter how many <code>#</code> there are.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, the filename of the <em>Obsidian</em> note is derived from the header.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the first caracter of the draft is NOT a <code>#</code>, the first line won’t be the note’s filename. Instead, the filename will be the creation date and time of the draft, in ISO format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case :</p>
<ul>
<li>A YAML metadata header is added at the top of the note, with an entry with the creation date and time of the draft.</li>
<li>The draft tags are added at the bottom of the note, below a separator line.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <em>Directory</em>, the action is → <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1oW" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> ← .</p>

<a name="what-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#what-1"></a>WHAT</h3>
<p>This action creates a new draft from selected text with appropriate back links in the new and source drafts. You can specify a title to be used for the new draft and corresponding back-link by placing ((double brackets)) around an appropriate title within the selected text. If no title is specified within the block of text, the action prompts for a title.</p>
<p>If you have selected text, that selected text will be replaced with a back-link. If you don’t select any text, the text of the current line will be used to create a new draft, and the back-link will be appended to that line in the source draft (rather than replacing it).</p>

<a name="why-2" class="anchor" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com#why-2"></a>WHY</h3>
<p>“If your notes are too broad, you might not notice when you encounter some new idea about one of the notions contained within, and links to that note will be muddied. If your notes are too fragmented, you’ll also fragment your link network, which may make it harder to see certain connections.”<br>
—Andy Matuschak, Evergreen notes should be atomic<br>
<a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic</a></p>
<p>I can see the wisdom of atomic notes, but I don’t think in atoms. For me, atomic notes emerge from free-flow thought (or other note-making). This action allows me to write expansively as ideas occur and extract emerging ideas after the fact, while retaining some sense of how those ideas emerged and where they came from.</p>
<p>I thought a few other actions like this already existed, but I couldn’t find them on a quick search. If you find this useful, you might also be interested in <a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/jochi">@jochi</a>’s Link Helper action group (which includes an action that does something similar to the the action I’ve made here).</p><aside class="onebox allowlistedgeneric">

<p>While not a full-fleged Twitter client when it comes to interacting and reading tweets, Drafts text manipulation capabilities have many advantages. When it comes to the drafting of new tweets, Drafts can shine with features like automatic replacement of common abbreviations, or creating a long Twitter thread in one go (<em>Tweet Storm</em>).</p>

            <p>Inspired by a Craft user i initially created an action to crosslink a task in things and a note in Craft. Since I‘m a Todoist user i quickly created a similar action for todoist. And now I was asked by a user in the forum here to adapt the action for Omnifocus.<br>
I’m happy to share that the cross linking is now available for the three big task management apps Todoist, Things and now Omnifocus.<br>
You can download them in the action directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1kp">Crosslink Todoist</a></li>
<li><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1k7"> Crosslink Things </a></li>
<li><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1lZ"> Crosslink Omnifocus </a></li>

            <p>I only recently noticed that version 20.0 of the app had added the <code>editor.recentDrafts</code> property, so I’ve updated my <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Wc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Quick Open</a> action to use this, which means it runs much faster than before. It’s now just a one-liner:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">editor.load(editor.recentDrafts[0])
</code></pre>
<p>If you haven’t used it before, it assigns the ⌘O keyboard shortcut to open the previous draft. Designed for when you’ve left the app for longer than the new draft creation timeout period but want to quickly resume what you were previously working on. Simple but effective.</p>

          <title>A Soulver Shortcut and Drafts Action</title>

          <category>Actions - Share What You&#39;ve Made</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I recently noticed that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977?uo=4" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Toolbox Pro</a> had a <code>Calculate with Soulver</code> Shortcuts action, which allows text to be run through the <a href="https://github.com/soulverteam/SoulverCore" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">engine</a> that powers the Soulver app. Even better, it’s the version of the engine from <a href="https://soulver.app" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Soulver 3</a>, which is currently Mac only, although an iOS version <a href="https://twitter.com/soulver/status/1285411054269284354?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">is on the way</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51db5ccfe1fa45f98dbae4f3e10a0a67" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">I made a shortcut</a> which makes use of this Toolbox Pro action in Shortcuts to do quick calculations in natural language. It can be run either as a standalone shortcut, in which case it prompts for input, or via a <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1kB" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">companion action</a> in Drafts. I like having the Drafts option available because I’m used to opening Drafts to jot things down. Using it as a quick calculation scratchpad also feels quite natural. Multiple calculations can be entered on separate lines, and the result for each is appended after an equals sign on the same line. It’s not as powerful as Soulver 3 for iOS will be, but for now it’s useful to have around.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I did a search in the Actions directory for “table of contents” and didn’t find anything, so made a quick <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1jv" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Table of Contents Action</a>.</p>
<p>The handy “Your topic is similar to…” prompt showed me <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/toc-auto-table-of-contents-in-multimarkdown/6283/13">a thread about the \{{TOC}} feature of MultiMarkdown</a>, so maybe my Action is redundant. If you would like the table of contents rendered as Markdown in your draft not just the preview, or you are using GitHub Flavored Markdown, maybe this action is still useful for you.</p>
<p>I also want to add links to headers from the table of contents in the next version. It looks like the \{{TOC}} feature tries to do this, but it doesn’t work.</p>
<p>If the Action gets some usage I will add proper helpful error handling when headers and placeholders can’t be found, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I made another Action that uses Write Good to check your writing style a while ago but didn’t post it here. You can search for “Write Good” in the directory, sorry I’ve hit my link limit for my first post.</p>
<p>I hope someone finds this useful. If you use it I welcome any feedback.</p>

            <p>With massive help from <a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/sylumer">@sylumer</a>, I created an action to get your most recent or current calendar event and add to the title of your current draft. This is to aid in referencing your drafts later when you are taking notes in a meeting.</p>
<p>I created this after searching the Drafts directory and coming up short. I’m honestly surprised no one has thought of this one before, as it seems like such a common use case.</p>
<p>A couple of things I’m hoping to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better title (this one’s a mouthful, but at least it’s accurate?)</li>
<li>Add attendees</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, here it is. Happy for feedback!</p>

            <p>Several tools I use like Clean Text have actions that they refer to as “removing empty lines”, so that is what I was searching for here and in the Action Directory.</p>
<p>However, I did stumble across two actions that were for removing “blank lines.” Figured I would post here in case someone else doesn’t think of the alternative <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/laughing.png?v=9" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>
<p>Single action: <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Er" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Remove blank lines</a></p>
<p>3 in 1: <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1BM" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Draft Modifier</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove Blank Lines</li>
<li>Remove Duplicate Lines</li>
<li>Split Draft at Cursor</li>
</ul>
