            <p>Is there a way to select which Gmail account a Drafts email action opens?<br>
I am usually logged into two gmail accounts, one personal and one for business. But when I compose a message and click the email action it opens a new email draft in Gmail but it’s not even clear which account it is, and no way to change.<br>
Is this possible?<br>
Thanks!</p>

            <p>I’m trying to modify <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1yz" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Spark Mailer v2</a> to use the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6068" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">mailto URL scheme</a> instead of the <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/which-ios-email-apps-support-automation-shortcuts-url-schemes-x-callback-url/3552/9" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Spark URL Scheme</a>.  The reason for making the conversion is that apparently using mailto allows &lt;newline&gt; characters embedded into the &lt;body&gt; whereas they are ignored using the Spark (and perhaps all other email) URL Schemes.  (<a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/need-spark-action-that-sends-copies/12486/21">Details here</a>.)</p>
<p>Here’s the test code I’m using:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">// Test data - Remove
let strNicknameList = "nicknameList"
let strEmailTo = "nameTo1&lt;acctTo1@domain.tld&gt;"
let strEmailCc = "nameCC1&lt;acctCC1@domain.tld&gt;"
let strEmailBcc = "nameBCC1&lt;acctBCC1@domain.tld&gt;"
let strPageTitle = "pageTitle";
let strPageURL = "pageURL";
let strPageSelection = "pageSelection";


// Build and call the mailto URL
// Use the callback object to make adding parameters easier ... but *NOT* running as a call back.
// Base settings
let cburlMailto = CallbackURL.create();
cburlMailto.waitForResponse = false;
cburlMailto.baseURL = "mailto:" + strEmailTo;
// Who else gets it
if (strEmailCc != "") cburlMailto.addParameter("cc", strEmailCc);
if (strEmailBcc != "") cburlMailto.addParameter("bcc", strEmailBcc);
// Subject line
cburlMailto.addParameter("subject", strPageTitle);
// Body
cburlMailto.addParameter("body",`${strNicknameList}

${strPageURL}


${strPageSelection}`);

// Log Url string - Remove
console.log("cburlMailto: " + cburlMailto());

// Open default mailer
cburlMailto.open();
</code></pre>
<p>My problem is trying to display the string built in <code>cburlMailto</code>.</p>
<p>How do I log it on the console or display it in an alert?</p>

          <title>Query from new user re: lists of dates in Fantastical</title>

            <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I’m a new user (under a year) and I’m just now starting to find my feet with this wonderful app. I’m still at the basic stages, but wow. The extent of actions available is blowing my mind.</p>
<p>I have a question about actions that I can’t find the answer to, and I’m hoping someone can assist.</p>
<p>I have found the Drafts to Fantastical action and that works brilliantly. I type a Draft, send it to Fantastical and it appears. No issues there.</p>
<p>It is possible for me to type a list of dates within a single Draft and to send them to Fantastical and create a number of different events? When I do that at the moment, it creates a “proposal” of a single event with a number of different possible times/dates rather than multiple events, which is what I am after.</p>
<p>Any guidance gratefully received.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

          <title>Evaluate Template Tags in Current Draft</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Isshin]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Actions - Help &amp; Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I would like to evaluate placeholder template tags in an already existing Draft and update the draft in-place, without having to create a new document from a template. I’m basically code illiterate. I have, in the past, managed to modify some existing scripts to meet my needs, but I seem to be completely stuck on the fundamentals here.</p>
<p>Basically, I want to grab anything in the current Draft that uses the template tags like <code>[[date]]</code> or <code>&lt;&lt;TextExpander_snippet&gt;&gt;</code> and replace that placeholder with appropriate information. I’m okay with either just grabbing the current line or evaluating the draft as a whole. I thought it would be simpler to process the Draft as a whole instead of trying to get tricky with selectors, but I’m not even having luck there.</p>
<p>Based on my extremely limited understanding of scripting syntax I thought something like this would work: <code>let updated_text = processTemplate(draft.content);</code></p>
<p>Edit:<br>
This works for tags like <code>[[date]]</code></p>
<p><code>draft.content = draft.processTemplate("[[draft]]”);</code><br>
<code>draft.update();</code></p>
<p>but TextExpander shortcuts like <code>&lt;&lt;ldate&gt;&gt;</code> do not work even though typing the abbreviation <code>ldate</code> into Drafts manually <em>does</em> expand as expected.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to take the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18j">New Linked Draft</a> action a step further:</p>
<p>I would like to add an action to the script when it executes so the the new draft created includes more than just the [[title]].</p>
<p>I believe I am dealing with this portion of the script:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	// create the new linked draft
	let d = Draft.create();
	d.content = p.fieldValues["title"];
	d.content = d.processTemplate(template);
	let tags = p.fieldValues["tags"].split(",").map(s =&gt; s.trim());
	for (let tag of tags) {
		d.addTag(tag);
	} 
	d.update();
</code></pre>
<p>Many thanks for your guidance.</p>

            <p>I have lines of text in a plain text document with “fields” separated by spaces or tabs. (I don’t have the ability to convert this to, say, a CSV file because the separation of the “fields” using tabs or spaces is not consistent, unfortunately.) I’d like to highlight certain “fields” or in some cases all items after the first for deletion. I could do this if I could highlight text in columns, rather than lines. Is something like this even possible in Draft.</p>
<p>Any thoughts would be most appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi there! I am considering moving to NotePlan 3 as my Task Management system, since I am a Setapp subscriber. There are a couple of NotePlan actions and action groups in the directory, however I can’t find any action that will take a list of items and turn them into separate tasks in NotePlan. Does anybody have any suggestion on how to accomplish this? Thanks!</p>

          <title>Accessing the Clipboard from Javascript</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bws950]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Actions - Help &amp; Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have an action set up that lets me create a document that (in relevant part) includes a Bible passage obtained through an online API and pastes it into a broader template.  I’m using the Insert ESV Text action from the Drafts Directory (<a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1SM" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>) to obtain a different passage each day; that action is set up, using Javascript, to provide a prompt to the user asking for the relevant passage, which it then submits to the API, ultimately returning the text of the passage.</p>
<p>I’d like to modify the action so that rather than prompting me for the relevant passage, it instead pulls the passage from the clipboard (i.e., the clipboard would already contain the text that I’d otherwise type into the prompt, and would just run automatically without requiring any interaction from the user).  I’m almost completely Javascript-illiterate, though, and haven’t been able to figure out how to access the clipboard from within the script or to set a variable to the clipboard.  (I’ve pasted the the script below; I <em>think</em> that what I need to do is set the “passage” variable to be the clipboard.)</p>
<p>Is there a way to accomplish that using javascript?  (I tried defining a Template tag in Drafts and then using that template tag within the Script step of my action, but that did not work.)  Thanks very much in advance for any help!</p>

          <title>Drafts on iPad keyboard activation suppression</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ALikelyLad]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Actions - Help &amp; Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m trying to use a single Drafts document for a glossary of approximately 100 terms (subject irrelevant). It would be handy to be able to refer to the glossary on the iPad as well as the Mac.<br>
Each term is a markdown heading and its definition is body text subordinate to the heading. I want to make heavy use of within-document links based on the headings as navigation markers.</p>
<p>On the iPad, with the onscreen keyboard closed, when I tap on a link. the document is scrolled to the relevant marker but the keyboard is activated. In (preferred) landscape mode, it takes up half the screen depth. Drafts scrolls the document intelligently to the marker but the text for which the marker is the header is typically multi-line and all but the top couple of lines are covered by the keyboard.</p>
<p>I can of course dismiss the keyboard with a single tap but I would like not to have this inconvenience.<br>
In portrait mode, the k/b occupies about 1/3 of the screen depth. With the drafts list hidden, the greater editor width reduces the number of lines needed to display an entry.</p>
<p>Is there a way to achieve the behaviour I’m looking for? Can the editor be put into a mode in which it responds to taps on links but doesn’t activate the keyboard?</p>
<p>In the Editor settings, I see “Edit on draft selection” but both its settings don’t seem to affect the current behaviour. I also tried in Preview but the navigation-marker-based links are inactive. I guess what I’m after is something like “Activate k/b on jump to navigation marker”; it would be false for the behaviour I’m after.</p>
<p>I’m happy to do some scripting if someone can kickstart me but it’s hard to imagine a scripted interaction as simple as tapping on a link. Sorry about the essay! On Drafts Pro 31.2 and iPadOS 15.4.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>I’m in the process of writing some light user-manual type material in the form of separate drafts in their own workspace. Once I’ve finished writing them I’d like to be able to ‘get them all out of the workspace’ in one batch, ideally. I haven’t decided how, yet. Is there a way that I could select a workspace and run the appropriate action on all drafts in that workspace, rather than having to go through and do each one manually?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Ben</p>

            <p>I am looking for a way to use the transcribing feature in Drafts (<a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/transcription" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Transcribing Audio &amp; Video - Drafts User Guide</a>) to automatically transcribe audio memos.</p>
<p>The dream is to have a process like:<br>
Pressing record in Apple Voice Memos → making the recording → pressing stop → Drafts automaticly triggers and starts transcribing the audio.</p>
<p>Additionally it would be nice if the finished draft included a link to the audio file in iCloud.</p>
<p>I have tied playing around with it in Shortcuts, but can’t really find a way to trigger the transcribing feature. Wondering if it would be able to do something like this with a Drafts action triggered by Shortcuts?</p>
<p>Thought maybe one of you Drafts wizards would have some ideas to how this could be solved.</p>

            <p>Please excuse me if I’m posting this in the wrong area of the Community.</p>
<p>I much prefer <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-mail-email-by-readdle/id997102246" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Spark</a> over Mail.</p>
<p>Mail is very well supported by Drafts via the Mail Action Step, but I’m having trouble finding a similar level of support for Spark.  Yes, there are four <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=Spark+" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Actions for Spark</a> in the directory, but none of them enables all the parameters of Spark’s x-callback-url scheme: subject, body, to, cc, and bcc.  Specially, I need support for all these parameters other than bcc.</p>
<p>How do I write my own Action Step for Spark that supports at least: subject, body, to, and cc?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Here is my current script:</p>
<p>let f = () =&gt; {<br>
// select an existing draft<br>
let d = Draft.find(“01AB846B-FA59-4D98-91B2-E7F52DBE3C63”);<br>
if (!d) {<br>

}</p>
<pre><code>// append current draft
draft.content = draft.content + " " + d.content;
draft.update();
return true;	
</code></pre>

<p>if (!f()) {<br>
context.cancel();<br>
}</p>
<p>What do I need to do to bring the revised note back as the active note?</p>

            <p>Forgive this post if this has been answered elsewhere. I’ve been using the “Append to Evernote Journal” action which seems to work well. I have 2 Evernote accounts however and would like to have the action in Drafts twice so that I can send different items to each Evernote account. I saw some things online about changing the “credentials” but have been unable to locate that option. Does anyone know of a way to set this action (or a similar one) up and be able to direct it to different accounts in Evernote?</p>

            <p>I have this action and it works well by itself. It basically wraps the selection and encloses it in the following format: {{c1:: selection goes in here }}</p>
<p>So I wanted to added a return key space or <br> before it encloses meaning like this:</p>
<p><strong>Prior to hitting the action</strong> This is the example and the selection goes in here</p>
<p><strong>After hitting the action</strong></p>
<p>This is the example and the</p>
<p>{{c1:: selection goes in here }}</p>
<p>This the current action I have, its in two steps</p>
<ol>
<li>{{c1::[[selection]]}</li>
<li>}</li>
</ol>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. I tried to add the <br> {{c1::[[selection]]} but that just that just literally the characters <br></p>
<p>Also tried this but didn’t quite work → %%&nbsp;%%{{c1::[[selection]]}</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I usually click <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/10q" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">insert date</a> action when I enter drafts in the main Drafts window. I also use the quick capture (in Mac) a lot and it does not seem to support actions at this moment. Am I missing some settings to enable this?</p>
<p>Otherwise, I can only think of using text expansion software if I want to have a timestamp in quick capture.</p>

            <p>I work in a team and use Asana and Drafts. I want to be able to send a draft to Asana, with fields from the draft that feed into it (i.e. task, project, due date, assignee). I see few if any posts about Asana at all. Can someone help guide me?</p>

            <p>I followed <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/Jaipal_Singh">Jaipal_Singh</a>’s steps from here <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/thought-asylum-alfred-4-workflow-issue/11516" class="inline-onebox">Thought asylum / Alfred 4 workflow issue</a>  and got my dlog command working. But somehow it’s only adding to whatever draft I’ve already got going for the day (or sometimes even a past draft), as opposed to creating a new draft and putting the entry there?</p>
<p>I feel so close and yet so far away!</p>

            <p>A one-button way to turn all lines in a draft into a single paragraph would be useful.</p>
<p>Primary use case is turning a PDF, or other source that divides text into multiple lines, into something that reads smoothly with a screen reader or text-to-speech functionality.</p>
<p>A screen reader doesn’t need paragraphs for readability, so all one paragraph would be fine and the most efficient method toward the desired end.</p>
<p>Many thanks,<br>
