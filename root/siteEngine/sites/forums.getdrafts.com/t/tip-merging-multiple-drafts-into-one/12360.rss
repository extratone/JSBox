To use merge:

* Go to the draft list
* Tap &quot;Select&quot; to enter select mode.
* Tap the drafts you would like to merge, in the order you would like to merge them.
* Tap &quot;Operations&quot;, and select the &quot;Merge&quot; operation.

On Mac, the process is similar:

* Select multiple drafts by holding down the command key and clicking on each.
* Secondary-click (right-click) on the draft list and select &quot;Merge&quot;.</description>

  <blockquote>
    I am using the shortcut action “Create Draft with Dictation” to create multiple drafts during the day detailing what I just accomplished and what is next on the plate. 
At the end of the day, I have a workspace which contains all these drafts, each generally just a few lines in length. My goal is to create an action which processes these drafts, prepending the timestamp on each one, then merging all the drafts in the workspace into one. 
For Example: 
Draft 1 (Created 08:03) 
Got Coffee and tria…

<p>I suspect at the least, you might well be able to revise the action created by <a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/flohgro">@FlohGro</a>, shared in that thread, to do the sort of thing that you want.</p>

            <p>Is there a way to add create time stamp of each drafts when they merged? I’d think it will be useful to know when each drafts was created.</p>
