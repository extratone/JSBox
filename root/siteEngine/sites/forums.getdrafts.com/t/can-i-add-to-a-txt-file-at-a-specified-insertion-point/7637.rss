    <description>Hi, I have what might be quite a niche use case that I&#39;m hoping some smart person here can help me solve for. Here&#39;s the **tl;dr**, and after that I&#39;ll go into a few more specifics:

&gt; I want to be able to add the text of a draft to a Dropbox-hosted .txt file at a predetermined point

Phrased another way: I *almost* want to prepend to an existing file, but I need to leave in place the first four lines of that file.

***

OK, a bit of context. I use a blogging tool called [Blot](https://blot.im) which operates by mirroring a Dropbox folder, and turning anything in that folder into a blog post or page. (It&#39;s super neat, surprisingly versatile, and I enjoy using it a great deal.) In order to take advantage of some of Blot&#39;s functions, I need to use the first few lines of an uploaded text file for metadata. For example, a typical blog post .txt file will start something like this:

```
Title: Title of Post
Date: YYYY-mm-dd
Permalink: permalink
Tags: tag1, tag2
```

(Side note: Drafts is *fantastic* in combination with Blot. I&#39;ve built simple actions that push drafts, posts, and pages to Dropbox (and hence to my site) all with no problem. I basically have a Workspace set up in Drafts that acts as a dedicated writing space for my blog, with one-touch publishing actions.)

Now I&#39;m trying to work out a way of *updating* a page on my site, rather than adding one. Let&#39;s say I have a file named Wire.txt and it begins like this: 

```
Title: Wire
Permalink: wire
Menu: no

1 Jan 2020, 12:00
Hello World
```

I&#39;m trying to build a Drafts action that will add the text of a draft *before* &#39;1 Jan 2020, 12:00&#39;, but which will leave the three lines of metadata at the top of the file. What I&#39;m looking for essentially is a command that tells Drafts to go to line 5 of the .txt file and insert: 

```
[[date|%d %b %Y, %H:%M:%S]]  
[[draft]]  

```

It would be easy to append to the file, but I&#39;m looking to keep a reverse-chronological log, so I need it to go at the top. If I choose prepend it pushes the metadata down, and the file stops working as intended at Blot&#39;s end. 

Any and all assistance greatly appreciated. If I&#39;ve not made something clear by all means just ask. 

***

For additional context:

1. I was hopeful this might be solvable with the `[[line|n]]` content tag, but as far as I can see that&#39;s referring to lines in the draft itself, not lines in the file you&#39;re altering. 

2. I looked at the `/replaceRange` parameter to see if I could figure out an x-callback-url implementation, but that requires a defined length for the insertion, and I&#39;m looking for the freedom to add a draft of any given length.</description>

            <p>That’s great news! I’ve just had a look at Blot, thanks for mentioning it, very interesting indeed.</p>
<p>If it’s not too cheeky to ask, would you mind sharing the action you’ve come up with to prepend below the first 4 lines?</p>

            <p>You would need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read in the Dropbox file (see <a href="https://scripting.getdrafts.com/classes/dropbox" rel="nofollow noopener">Drafts scripting reference for Dropbox</a>).</li>
<li>Split the file content by line break.</li>
<li>Join the first 4 lines of file content with the draft content and the remaining lines of file content (in that order - there are various ways to do this in JavaScript).</li>
<li>Write that new set of content back to the Dropbox file to overwrite it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
