    <title>How / where would i look to understand [[draft]]?</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/how-where-would-i-look-to-understand-draft/5073</link>
    <description>Hello, I am trying to understand drafts scripting, not html scripting.
I would like to limit my ambitions to learning to read and make modifications to scripts.
Where would I look if I simply want to understand the syntax and meaning of a simple script like [[draft]]
thank you for your time and help</description>

            <p>Greg’s link above just opens this thread for me, but the template tags page I linked above has a description of all the tags.</p>

Regardless of what the purpose of the step is, any steps that output information have some fields that allow you to control what text is used by the step, and (with a few small exceptions) use templates to dynamically generate that text.
