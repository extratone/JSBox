    <title>[Tip] The draft selection interface for knowledge-management</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-the-draft-selection-interface-for-knowledge-management/8826</link>
    <description>...alternatively titled “Showing a little love for app.selectDraft.” 

The draft selection interface is a bit of an unsung hero. It’s been a feature of Drafts for a good while now (since 2018, in some form?) but it was only earlier this year that I really began to appreciate how useful it is. 

Because it can retain context separately from the drafts displayed in the drafts list, and because its two-column grid (on an iPad) offers a higher information density than the regular single-column drafts list, it’s really useful to use as a complementary side-panel for navigating a custom workspace. Since there’s been a bit more talk about Roam/Obsidian-equivalent features in Drafts recently: this interface can be a functional equivalent to a side-panel of related items, even if it has to be loaded manually via an action.

# Use cases 

For anyone new to using Drafts as a tool for note-taking and/or knowledge management: 
- If you haven’t used the selection interface before and want to try it out, [this action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1do) allows you to call the interface and load a selected draft.
- [Greg’s action for inserting wiki-links](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/184) is a useful starter. We don’t have in-line auto-completion of wiki-links, but this works well as an alternative.
- Need to review the contents of a related draft without navigating away from the primary draft you were focusing on? It’s not too difficult to imagine using the selection interface in an action that opens a related draft in a new window or preview. 
- It’s also relatively easy to create actions that allow you to filter sets of drafts as indexes to choose from. For example: an action on your extended keyboard that allows you to insert a wiki-link from a selection of active projects (where each of those active projects is a draft with a consistent tag or tag-set to base the filter on). 
- Other useful examples of actions based on this selection interface include [selecting drafts to append or insert](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-working-with-existing-drafts/3666).

            <p>Thanks for putting this together!</p>
<p>I’ve run into a little bit of buggy behavior with <code>[[</code> autocomplete — and would ideally love to use the Quick Search prompt — but looks like working with <code>app.selectDraft()</code> is the only alternative right now.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/agiletortoise">@agiletortoise</a> didn’t know if you’d considered having <code>app.showQuickSearch()</code> have the option of returning a <code>Draft</code> object rather than <code>void</code>? (I’ve found Quick Search to be pretty elite at full text search, but <code>[[</code> autocomplete is 1) only by title and 2) disappears if a typo occurs.)</p>

<p>Fair point. And shows up my biases in terms of how I use Drafts!</p>
<p>I’ve updated the original post to acknowledge this, and included a link to a simple starter action that calls the interface. <a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/greiggy">@greiggy</a>: if you’re still interested after the above explanations, try that first action I’ve added to the list of use cases.</p>
