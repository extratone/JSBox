    <title>Light/Dark mode switches still pretty flaky</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/light-dark-mode-switches-still-pretty-flaky/11742</link>
    <description>When switching back to Drafts after a light/dark mode change, when Drafts hasn&#39;t been used recently (&lt;- that part is important, this is tough to repro), it&#39;s usually stuck on the previous mode.

And switching away + switching back to Drafts usually only changes background colors, not foreground/text... it&#39;s weird.

I have a feeling that the APIs that Drafts calls (when it wakes back up / is switched to) are either lying to it or are stale / untrustworthy.

May need to make a 2nd query, after a 1s delay maybe, to really be sure you&#39;ve been given the right mode by iOS.

This happens to me almost daily on both iPhone and iPad. Latest version of iOS on both, latest store version of the app.</description>

            <p>Safe to say this is likely <em>always</em> related to the system having changed between light-dark automatically (like on a schedule) while Drafts was running in the background?</p>
