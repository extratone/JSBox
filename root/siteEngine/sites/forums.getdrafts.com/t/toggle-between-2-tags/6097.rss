    <title>Toggle between 2 tags</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/toggle-between-2-tags/6097</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to create an action to toggle between 2 possible tags. Basically, if a Draft has &quot;tag1&quot;, I&#39;d like to switch it to &quot;tag2&quot; and visa versa.
I can&#39;t find anything in the Action Directory that does this (or something similar that I can hack around with). Can anyone suggest a plan of attack?

Thanks!

            <p>That does the trick quite nicely. Thanks so much for the help!</p>
<p>(I’m not worried about if the Draft already has both or neither tag - if it was being built for other users, maybe.)</p>

            <p>A script step like this should give you the basis for it I think.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">let strTag = "foo";
if (draft.hasTag(strTag)) draft.removeTag(strTag);
else draft.addTag(strTag);
draft.update();
</code></pre>
<p>Just account for it not being one tag but two and so you need to do an add and remove each time.</p>
<p>But also what happens should you inadvertently have both or neither…?</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
