Howdy folks! After discovering that Drafts includes [a WebDAV service](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#webdav) a few days ago, I&#39;ve been toying around with my first attempt at Action development from scratch. I&#39;ve long fantasized about a more direct way to interact with my NeoCities site(s) - (NeoCities supports WebDAV as its exclusive means of remote file management.)    The end goal for the Action Group would be to utilize Drafts&#39; WebDAV support to its absolute fullest extent to interact with/manage files on a web server over WebDAV.

So far, I&#39;ve been able to push drafts to the server successfully but only when titled by UUID or Timestamp. (`[[uuid]].html/[[time]].html`)  When I try to use `[[title]]` or `[[display_title]]`, the resulting path is unreadable for some reason.

Anywho, I thought I&#39;d open a thread here. Any suggestions/tips from those of you with more experience developing actions are more than welcome!

Here&#39;s [the (unlisted) Action Directory link](https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1uF) for those with the time/curiosity to check on my progress.</description>

            <p>Not sure I understand what is happening to filenames, but the tag you probably want for filename is <code>[[safe_title]]</code> (<a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates#tags">docs</a>), which creates a filename safe version of the title - removing path characters, etc.</p>
