    <title>Append to selected file (from list of running files – a la Merlin Mann&#39;s &quot;runx&quot; file scheme)</title>

    <description>Like Merlin Mann*, I have a series of &quot;running files&quot; to which I&#39;m constantly adding content:

- runx movies.txt
- runx restaurants.txt
- runx gift ideas.txt
- runx books I&#39;ve read.txt
...

I could use the &quot;[Append to Running Lists](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-append-to-running-lists-with-the-add-to-list-action/596)&quot; action, but I&#39;d like prefer to have separate files that I can also access from my Mac.

I could set up an action for each of these (variations on &quot;Append to iCloud Journal&quot;:  &quot;Append to Movie List&quot;, &quot;Append to Gift Idea List&quot;, etc.), but it would be great if I could have _one action_ that prompts me with buttons for each of them (about 10, say), so that I can pick the destination and have the [[draft]] text appended to the corresponding file in the background.

Any ideas for how to write an Action that allows the pathname/filename to be determined from a list of options?

            <p>You can use a <a href="http://getdrafts.com/actions/steps/prompt">Prompt</a> to create the selections. Specify buttons for the prompt with a pipe separated list like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">movies|restaurants|gift ideas
</code></pre>
<p>Then, in the step after that appends to a file (iCloud Drive, Dropbox, whatever you are using), use the <code>[[prompt_button]]</code> tag in the path, like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/runx [[prompt_button]].txt
</code></pre>
<p>(That assumes the default “prompt” key for the prompt step)</p>
<p>That should get you what you want.</p>
