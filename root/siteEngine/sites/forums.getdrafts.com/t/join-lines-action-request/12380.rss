    <description>A one-button way to turn all lines in a draft into a single paragraph would be useful.

Primary use case is turning a PDF, or other source that divides text into multiple lines, into something that reads smoothly with a screen reader or text-to-speech functionality.

A screen reader doesn’t need paragraphs for readability, so all one paragraph would be fine and the most efficient method toward the desired end.

Many thanks,
Tim

    I scan documents using the OCR feature in iOS 15 and use a simple mail action afterwards. How do I remove all line breaks before sending the text? 
Thanks!
