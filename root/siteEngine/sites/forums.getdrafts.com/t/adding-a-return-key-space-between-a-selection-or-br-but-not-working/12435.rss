    <title>Adding a return key space between a selection or &lt;br&gt; but not working</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/adding-a-return-key-space-between-a-selection-or-br-but-not-working/12435</link>
    <description>I have this action and it works well by itself. It basically wraps the selection and encloses it in the following format: {{c1:: selection goes in here }}

So I wanted to added a return key space or &lt;br&gt; before it encloses meaning like this:

**Prior to hitting the action** This is the example and the selection goes in here

**After hitting the action**

This is the example and the

{{c1:: selection goes in here }}

This the current action I have, its in two steps
1. {{c1::[[selection]]}
2. }

![Pasted Graphic 1|690x155](upload://i2BftPMsKVLQknup8GaaSxxxzzk.png)




Any help would be appreciated. I tried to add the &lt;br&gt; {{c1::[[selection]]} but that just that just literally the characters &lt;br&gt; 

Also tried this but didn&#39;t quite work → %%&amp;nbsp;%%{{c1::[[selection]]}

Thanks</description>

            <p>Line feeds can be put in the template of an “Insert Text” action step. That <em>sounds</em> like what you are asking for.  There’s no special markup needed, just add the line before the rest…like:</p>
