    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/installing-drafts-for-mac-without-icloud-and-appstore-access/10281</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been given a new laptop from my companies&#39; IT department, and was all excited to get my environment all set up, but IT has locked down iCloud access as well as App Store access.

I do have a Drafts Pro subscription, and downloaded the beta build onto the new Mac, but there seems to be no successful way that I can find to &quot;prove&quot; it to Drafts that I have a subscription, probably because of lack of iCloud access.

Two questions:

1. Is there a way to get this installed and working?
2. Without iCloud, is there any way to sync my drafts, or will this be a standalone instance, separate from my personal Drafts?</description>

            <p>An off the wall idea: Perhaps the state of being Pro could flow from eg an iOS device to eg a Mac. The common factor being the Apple ID that is used to Sync.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, Greg.</p>

<p>Sadly, it looks like they have someone who loves to go crazy with the policy tools.</p>
<p>I was hoping there would be a way with the beta build to confirm my pro subscription, but it looks to be using some sort of iCloud or AppStore lookup as well: <a href="https://d.pr/i/fC0u2r" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 11.47.53 AM.png • Droplr</a></p>
<p>My pro sub is still active on this Mac an all of my iOS devices: <a href="https://d.pr/i/HuKk0h" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 11.49.32 AM.png • Droplr</a></p>

            <p>Drafts is only distributed via the App Store at this time. It can run independently of iCloud as a local installation without sync, but you will need at least App Store access to install a working copy and unlock your Pro features.</p>
<p>Are you sure the App Store is locked down? It’s pretty common for corporate IT departments to block iCloud, but I haven’t run into them blocking the App Store entirely before.</p>
