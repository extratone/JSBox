    <title>Microsoft To Do</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/microsoft-to-do/10362</link>
    <description>I realize this is a long shot, but I am stuck in a Microsoft world at work and iOS/Apple environment at home. I am trying to locate an action or way to send tasks into Microsoft To Do by Drafts. Is this possible or is there a solution? The new Drafts Web Capture seems like it may be of use to do this if I can get it pushed to MS To Do. Thanks.</description>

    Hi — Another To Do fan here. By no means will the following do everything you want, but maybe it’ll give you or someone else a start. This script takes the first line of the current draft and posts it to a To Do task list, given an API key and a To Do folder ID, and then puts the API response in a new draft.
