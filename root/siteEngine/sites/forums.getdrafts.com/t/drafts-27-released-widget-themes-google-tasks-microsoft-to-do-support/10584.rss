    <description>## Drafts 27.0 has been released:

- [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1236254471?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;at=11l4Cf&amp;ct=site)
- [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1435957248?mt=12&amp;at=11l4Cf&amp;ct=site)

Details below. For a complete history of updates, visit:

- [Changelog](https://docs.getdrafts.com/changelog)

### Custom Theme Support for Widgets + New Action Icons 

It is now possible to select custom light and dark themes for Home Screen (iOS) and Notification Center (macOS) widgets from the built-in and [custom themes](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extending/themes) you have installed in Drafts. To make changes, tap and hold on a widget, select &quot;Edit Widget&quot;, and make changes in the widget configuration.

![r27|641x396, 75%](upload://3UOv24lffA1NNjQjd1sVBxiijy1.png)

We have also added dozens of new icons for actions/workspaces in categories like Health, Animals, Education, Email, and more.

If you create custom themes, you may wish to add the following new keys in `colors.interface`: `widgetBackground`, `widgetBackgroundAlternate`, `widgetForeground`, `widgetForegroundAlternate`. If not present, these values will fall back to existing related keys: `background`, `backgroundCollection`, `foreground`, so existing themes should work out of the box without updates.

### Google Tasks and Microsoft To Do Integration

Extensive integration with two of the most popular task managers:  Google Tasks and Microsoft To Do. This version adds new action steps which can create individual tasks, or add each line of draft as a task, to lists in either Google Tasks or Microsoft To Do.

![r27-2|641x396, 75%](upload://sxKpUk4XIWWlNs0vQjKZzkABsS1.png)

Both services are available via scripting, with powerful script objects with convenience methods for creating and updated tasks and lists, while also exposing the full APIs to advanced users.

- [**Using Drafts with Microsoft To Do**](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-drafts-with-microsoft-to-do/10574)

### Arrange Mode Improvements

[Arrange mode](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/arrangemode) has better external keyboard support, especially on iOS, including:
    - `Esc` and `⌘-return` to cancel or accept changes
    - Arrow keys navigate up-down in the list
    - `⌘-up/down` move the selected line up and down in the list.

#### Other Updates and Fixes

- **Change (iOS):** iOS 12 no longer supported.
- **Fix (iOS):** URL scheme could be called twice on cold start of app.
- **Fix:** Better support for import of exported files from Drafts 3 or earlier
- Script changes:
    - `Event` object properties:
        - `identifier`
        -  `attendees` array to access (readonly) attendee list.
        - `availability` string with values `busy`, `free`, `tentative`, `unavailable`, `notSupported`
    - `Reminder` object properties:
        - `identifier`
- **Fix:** Drafts set in the editor via `editor.load` should get added to recent drafts list.
- **Fix (iOS):** Messages app background in dark mode had issues.
- **Fix (macOS):** `loadActionGroup` and `loadActionBar` URLs were not supported on Mac.
- **Fix (macOS):** Possible fix case where &quot;Undo&quot; would stop working in the editor until the app was restarted.
- Refactor assets to save on binary size.</description>

            <p>The addition of Google Tasks is really nice. Although I use Todoist as my task manager, Google Tasks’ ability to appear in a side panel when working in Sheets is really handy. Having Drafts integration now makes it easy to run “repeat/rinse” setup checklists without having to import a “checklist” tab into Sheets itself. These also follow across to my Chromebook too. Great stuff.</p>
