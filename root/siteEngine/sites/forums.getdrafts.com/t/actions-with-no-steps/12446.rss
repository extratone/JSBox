    <title>Actions with No Steps</title>

    <description>I learned today that an Action with no steps can still insert tags when &quot;complete&quot;. If you frequently need to apply different combinations of tags, you can use the Menu system described in my last post to get access to several no-step Actions named something like:

Tags: Peter, Paul, Mary
Tags: John, Ringo, George, Paul
Tags: Oranges, Apples, Bananas

Include the comma-separated tags in the After Success options. This is one category of action that I can actually make work without hours of figuring out what I&#39;m doing wrong.</description>
