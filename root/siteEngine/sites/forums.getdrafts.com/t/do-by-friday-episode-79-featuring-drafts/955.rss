    <description>*Do by Friday* is a podcast hosted by Merlin Mann, Max Temkin and Alex Cox. They do a weekly challenge, and this week the challenge was to do cool things with Drafts.

They invited me on to discuss the app.  It&#39;s a fun podcast. Be warned, it&#39;s decidedly not safe for work. Drafts discussion starts around the 46 minute mark:
