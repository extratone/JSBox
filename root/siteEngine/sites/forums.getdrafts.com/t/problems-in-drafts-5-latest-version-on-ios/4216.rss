    <title>Problems in Drafts 5 (latest version) on iOS</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/problems-in-drafts-5-latest-version-on-ios/4216</link>
    <description>- If I swipe from the right side to make the action list appear, it doesn&#39;t happen for the first 3 or 4 times I try. In Drafts 4 this worked flawlessly. What can I do?
- The action list doesn&#39;t automatically disappear after selecting an option, like it used to in Drafts 4. Can I fix this or adjust this behaviour?

These behaviours make using Drafts 5 a hassle, which is the very thing it tries to eliminate. So it&#39;s very frustrating. I hope someone can help.</description>

            <p>I’m not aware of any issues with swiping for the action list. The behavior is slightly different in feel from Drafts 4 because it is an interactive swipe, but similar functionality is there.  The momentum is a little different, could it just be an adjustment to the new swiping behavior?</p>
<p>The action list disappearing behavior should be the same as in Drafts 4.  It remains visible if the action does nothing on success.  If the action is configured to <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/action-after-success-default-configured-on-action-groups/141">archive or trash after success</a>, a new draft is created (or the editor move to next draft in <a href="https://getdrafts.com/editor/focusmode" rel="nofollow noopener">focus mode</a>) and the action list is hidden.</p>
