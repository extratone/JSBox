    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to set up a running append note in bear for each day using Drafts the same as the one I have running with Evernote.  This was easy with even more because of the way Drafts integrates Evernote. Could we have the same integration for Bear?

Thanks

            <p>You’re welcome, I hope you’ll sort out your timezone problem.</p>
<p>I thought “excluding trash” would have been the default behaviour for “add-text”. I updated the BearAPI action to specify it.</p>

            <p>The timezone thing may have something to do with my devices as one was set to automatic and one manual although both were set to Vancouver.</p>
<p>Also it adds to notes in trash, but that is only really a problem when testing.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Weird, it does respect my timezone. Did you note it uses the creation date and not the modification date?</p>
<p>You can simply swap <code>createdAt</code> by <code>modifiedAt</code> if you want the modification date. You can also use <code>Date.now()</code>.</p>

            <p>Thanks Olivier</p>
<p>This gets me much closer than I got using the url scheme. I’ll play a little with it.</p>
<p>One initial problem I’m seeing is is not respecting my timezone which is Pacific.</p>

            <p>You might be interested by the script API I wrote for Bear: <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/bear-script-api/87">Bear script API</a>.</p>
<p>The code to do what I understood you want is pretty simple:</p>
<pre><code>var title = "Journal for " + draft.createdAt.toLocaleDateString();
var text = draft.content + "\n_" + draft.createdAt.toLocaleString() + "_";
Bear.appendTo(title, "section", text);
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Ep" rel="nofollow noopener">you an install it from the action directory</a>)</p>

            <p>It can be a little more tricky to configure in a URL because of the encoding requirements, but the same template tags as any template in Drafts are applicable.</p>
<p>In the case of the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Em">bear example</a> you mention, you would need to change the <code>text=[[draft]]</code> parameter so it also contains the timestamp…likely something like: <code>text=[[time]]%0A[[draft]]</code>.  This would add the time value, and a line feed.  The “%0A” is a URL encoded line feed.</p>
<p>You can also make sure a string is URL encoded using {{ }} in a Drafts template.</p>
<p>To tweak that, check on other available tags in the <a href="http://getdrafts.com/actions/templates">template docs</a>.</p>

            <p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>I tried it and it worked as designed and it wouldn’t be hard to change to a day journal but it doesn’t do the bit I’ve struggled with the url scheme which is to time stamp each entry so I end up with one note each day containing time stamped entries.</p>
<p>As shared yours just includes each entry workout ant indication of when each entry was made.</p>

            <p>I just finished up an posted a <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-bear-with-drafts/79">Bear integration guide</a> which links to a couple of example actions, including one that demonstrates appending to a monthly journal.  Hopefully this is some help.</p>
<p>Josh is right that Bear does not have a web API to integrate with like Evernote, but you can accomplish most of the same things with their URL schemes.</p>

            <p>Hi John</p>
<p>Thanks for that. I wasn’t aware it was api based. I have to tried to set it up using the bear url scheme before and technically it is possible but the append using a variable in the title doesn’t seem to work.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I don’t believe that type of interaction is possible as Bear doesn’t have an API that is accessible by third party devs like Evernote does.</p>
<p>But you can create actions with a URL scheme with /add-text Action from Bears URL scheme documentation, which can be found here: <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/X-callback-url%20Scheme%20documentation/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/X-callback-url%20Scheme%20documentation/</a></p>
