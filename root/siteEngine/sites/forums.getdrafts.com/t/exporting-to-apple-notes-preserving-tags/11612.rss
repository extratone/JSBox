    <title>Exporting to Apple Notes preserving tags</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/exporting-to-apple-notes-preserving-tags/11612</link>
    <description>Hi,
I&#39;ve got a bunch of drafts that I&#39;d like to export to the Apple Notes app. I have the &quot;Create note in Notes&quot; action and associated Shortcut. However, now that Monterey supports it, I&#39;d like to convert the drafts tags to Apple Notes tags by pasting them at the bottom with the &quot;#&quot; mark to identify them as tags. Anybody have any clue how to do this? I&#39;d be grateful.
Thanks!</description>

            <p>It is trivial to add Drafts tags as hashtags when exporting. In fact there’s a <code>[[hashtags]]</code> template tag that can be used in Drafts actions to include tags in <code>#hashtag</code> format (<a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-drafts-templates/3728">more on templates</a>).</p>
<p>That said, this won’t help you to tag items in Apple Notes. Best as I have been able to tell from testing in the new release of Notes, it <em>only</em> recognizes and tags a note if the <code>#hashtag</code> is <strong>typed</strong> into the note. If you paste in text with tags, or use the Shortcuts or AppleScript methods to set the content of a note, it ignores those tags. They appear as text, but it does not actually treat them as tags.</p>
<p>Apple would have to update Notes to support tags better to make this useful.</p>
