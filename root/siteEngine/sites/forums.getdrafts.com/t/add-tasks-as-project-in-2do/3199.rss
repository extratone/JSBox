(Note that this action should work even if some of the lines in the document are not tasks. The idea is that I could take notes at a meeting, add some tasks, and then have a new 2Do project for items to followup on after that meeting.)</description>

<blockquote>
<p>How do I append to an existing template tag within the script?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For this scenario, consider using a string variable to keep appending to and then substitute that in for “paste text” when you want to use it.</p>
<p>If it was pre-existing in some other scenarios, you might use processTemplate() to get the initial value to initialise the variable with.  You could consistently use processTemplate instead of a separate variable, but I personally think it is typically easier (for maintenance and explanation) to work with variables first and then the templates at the end of the process.</p>
<p>Hope that covers what you’re after.</p>

            <p>Currently my script parses each line and sends those it finds directly to 2Do, to modify it in this way I would need to append each found line to “s” (using the example above). How do I append to an existing template tag within the script?</p>

            <p>There are couple of ways to create that URL and open it without the need to create a new draft.</p>
<p>The most straightforward way would be to put the new text you constructed in a custom template tag, then use that tag in a Callback URL action step that follows your script, like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let s = " ... your constructed text ... ";
draft.setTemplateTag("paste_text", s);
</code></pre>
<p>Then for the URL scheme in a step after this script, use:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">twodo://x-callback-url/paste?text=[[paste_text]]&amp;forList=Inbox
</code></pre>
<p>You could also do it all in script, constructing the full URL in a string, and using a <a href="https://reference.getdrafts.com/objects/CallbackURL.html">CallbackURL</a> object to open that URL.</p>

            <p>So it turns out that it is actually fairly easy to create a project with sub tasks in 2Do using the “paste” URL scheme:</p>
<p><code>twodo://x-callback-url/paste?text=[[draft]]&amp;forList=Inbox</code></p>
<p>This works with nested text in a draft:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Project Title
    task 1
    task 2
</code></pre>
<p>So perhaps the best way to accomplish the initial concept would be to take the title and tasks and create a new draft, then run the URL scheme on that draft? Or is there an easier way?</p>
