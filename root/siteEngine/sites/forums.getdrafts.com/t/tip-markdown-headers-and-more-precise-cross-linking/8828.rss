    <description>Responding to the issue described in [[Discussion] Strict Cross Linking](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/discussion-strict-cross-linking/8789/8?u=jsamlarose): 

[quote=&quot;benhue, post:8, topic:8789&quot;]
if I had this note:

```
# Deterministic System

In [[Computer Science]] a deterministic system is a system that where no randomness is involved in the development of future states. So the same output will always be achieved from a given start condition or initial state.
```

Then if I have a reference to an article say called

```
# How a Deterministic System is the way forward

[[Deterministic System]] is the way forward as we move to a state driven  etc. etc.
```

Now if I link to `[[Deterministic System]]` from a different note I would run into the same issue.

Wiki-linking in Drafts has a fuzziness/looseness to it. That allows us to forego the leading “#” in linking to a draft by title, but creates an issue when the same text string is used within the title of more than one draft. A title needs to be unique if it&#39;s going to be used as a reference link; or to be more precise in this context: a wiki-link needs to at least be able to target something of a draft&#39;s title that is unique to that draft. If you target your drafts using UUIDs or Zettel style timestamps, you’ll most likely escape this issue.

Many of the available cross-linking actions make use of the `drafts.displayTitle` attribute, creating links based on titles without the leading “#”. So a draft titled `# Deterministic System` is linked to via `[[Deterministic System]]`. As case sensitivity isn’t considered, I can drop a `[[deterministic system]]` link in the natural flow of a block of text (note the lower case).

Sounds obvious, but in cases like this **consider including the “#” symbol in the wiki-link.** This allows you to use the title-text as text within the title of any other draft while avoiding link-clash. A link to `[[# deterministic system]]` should avoid the issues detailed in the post above.</description>

            <p>quite a nice and simple prefix solution.</p>
<p>I love it. It even works if you have a title like <code>### Lower Level Title</code> and still use it with a single hash <code>[[# Lower Level Title]]</code></p>
<p>Cool.</p>
