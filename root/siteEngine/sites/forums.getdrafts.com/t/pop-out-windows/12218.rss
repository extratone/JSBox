    <description>On my Mac, when I double click on a Draft&#39;s tab, a pop-out window appears. The window always pops out in the shape of a 3x3&#39; square. Is there a way to change this default shape? For example, I would prefer to have it shaped like a 2x4&quot; rectangle, which helps me maximize screen space on the side of the screen.</description>

            <p>Thank you for 31.1, “Change (Mac): Allow “open in new window” windows to remember last used size.” I appreciate it!!</p>

            <p>This would be helpful.</p>
<p>I’d add - opening workspaces and action panes on pop up windows ultimately sends in text justifying in a narrowing frame getting small with each additional open and close of the workspaces and action panes. Ongoings g for quite a while.</p>

            <p>I’ll take a look at this…I don’t think the positioning should change. It’s important that the new windows appear in a predictable tiling, but it current is forcing the size which is arbitrary and it should remember the size you last set for an alternate window.</p>

            <p>A follow up to my question, when I hit shift-command-2, the window for the quick capture is exactly the shape I would prefer for those windows that pop up when I click on one of the drafts in the Draft List.</p>
<p>Also, in passing, I wish to express my appreciation for the ‘float on top’ option for these Draft List windows. Thank you!</p>
