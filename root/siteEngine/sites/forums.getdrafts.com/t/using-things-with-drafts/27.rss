Things 3 can be integrated with Drafts in a number of powerful ways.

### Sending Individual Tasks

Things has an iOS Share extension which can be used with Drafts&#39; Share action, or URL-based actions can be used to send the text of the current draft as a task to Things inbox.

- [**Task in Things**](http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CO)
	- Send draft to Things as new task, using first line as the title and the remaining text as a note.
	
### Scripting Things

Drafts provides convenience wrappers for Things more advanced URL schemes which allow creation of multiple tasks or even whole projects with tags and dates assigned, etc.  

Documentation for [Things Scripting](https://scripting.getdrafts.com/classes/tjscontainer.html) is available at our Scripting Reference site, and many example actions utilizing these methods can be found by [searching the Action Directory](http://actions.getdrafts.com/search?utf8=✓&amp;search_type=actions&amp;q=things&amp;button=)

### Emailing To Things

Things also provides a [Mail to Things](https://support.culturedcode.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2908262-using-mail-to-things) feature which can be used along with Drafts [Mail script steps](http://getdrafts.com/actions/steps/mail) to send email to your unique Things email address.

### Other Advanced Examples
