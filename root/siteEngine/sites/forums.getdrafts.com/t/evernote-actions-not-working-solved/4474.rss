    <description>I deleted and recreated the credentials for Evernote. I can use the share menu to make it happen. But for all direct Evernote actions on all of my devices it just gives me the failed dialogue. Ideas?</description>

            <p>Thank you for taking the time. So checking the logs (duh!), it’s telling me that it’s not valid ENML. (My draft is set to export markdown).</p>
<p>So I played around with the specific draft and narrowed it down to two things. Looks like if your first line is blank it will fail. Also if you have this set <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e1fa1665d0bc3d35660a959a23c8aa310102bb37.jpeg" alt="IMG_726CAA0E09B3-1" width="154" height="120">  anywhere in the draft it will fail.</p>
<p>Learned something today… with your help!</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time.</p>

<li>Do you get any additional information in the log (see <a href="https://getdrafts.com/actions/" rel="nofollow noopener">show action log</a>).<br>
2.Are you 100% sure that your new Evernote credentials are correct?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I’ve had a quick look at the Evernote status listing and it doesn’t look like they have had any recent outages.</li>
<li>The share menu works with the app whilst the other actions are probably configured to work with the API, hence the credentials requirement.the</li>
