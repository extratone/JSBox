    <title>TIP: Performing Operations on Multiple Drafts</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-performing-operations-on-multiple-drafts/6532</link>
    <description>Sometimes, when you need to process a number of drafts, loading each individually in the editor to run actions, file, assign tags, etc., can be burdensome. That&#39;s why Drafts provides methods to select and perform operations on any number of drafts at the same time. Some of the available tools include:

- Run actions
- Assign, remove, rename tags.
- Flag/unflag
- Reassign syntaxes
- Merge/duplicate

Quick demo videos and instructions for performing batch operations on both iOS and the Mac follow.

## iOS Batch Operations

To perform batch operations on iOS:

- Open the draft list (Swipe to right or tap draft button in top left).
- Tap &quot;Select&quot; to enter select mode. Or *tap and hold select to Select All* currently displayed drafts.
- Tap drafts in the list to select or deselect them.
- Tap &quot;Operations&quot; to bring up the list of available actions.
- Select the operation you wish to perform. Additional prompts may follow if necessary.

## Mac Batch Operations

To perform batch operations on Mac:

- Open the draft list.
- Select drafts in the list using standard Mac list selection options:
    - `⌘-click` individual entries to toggle select
    - `shift-click` to select a range
- Open the context menu on the draft list using secondary click. This could be the right mouse button on a two button mouse, control-click or other method depending on your Mac configuration.
- Select the operation you wish to perform. Additional prompts may follow if necessary.

## Comments

- The `Merge` operation will merge drafts _in the order they were selected_. For most operations the selection order is not important.
- Some actions, particularly some URL based actions, are not compatible with the `Run Action` operation because they have indeterminate outcomes that make it problematic to chain them together.</description>
