    <title>Autocomplete in v29</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/autocomplete-in-v29/11536</link>
    <description>I have 3 autocomplete texts triggered by !!.  I can see them all in MacOS, but in iPadOS on my iPad Mini I can only see 1 and a bit of them.  If I try to scroll them or hide the keyboard they disappear.

I am interested to know how many entries of the autocomplete list you can see in iPadOS on which sized screen devices.

Thanks</description>
