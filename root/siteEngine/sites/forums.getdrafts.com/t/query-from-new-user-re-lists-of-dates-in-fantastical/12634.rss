    <title>Query from new user re: lists of dates in Fantastical</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/query-from-new-user-re-lists-of-dates-in-fantastical/12634</link>
    <description>Hi guys, 

I&#39;m a new user (under a year) and I&#39;m just now starting to find my feet with this wonderful app. I&#39;m still at the basic stages, but wow. The extent of actions available is blowing my mind. 

I have a question about actions that I can&#39;t find the answer to, and I&#39;m hoping someone can assist. 

I have found the Drafts to Fantastical action and that works brilliantly. I type a Draft, send it to Fantastical and it appears. No issues there. 

It is possible for me to type a list of dates within a single Draft and to send them to Fantastical and create a number of different events? When I do that at the moment, it creates a &quot;proposal&quot; of a single event with a number of different possible times/dates rather than multiple events, which is what I am after. 

Any guidance gratefully received. 

Thanks!</description>

            <p>There are some examples in the <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-fantastical-with-drafts/25">Fantastical integration guide</a>. Note that the version that parses multiple lines is <em>not</em> compatible with the Mac version of Fantastical, as they only support callback URLs on iOS.</p>
<p>You might find the separate linked example which offers similar functionality without relying on Fantastical useful as well.</p>
