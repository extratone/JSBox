    <title>Walling App / Notion</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/walling-app-notion/12185</link>
    <description>Late last year I discovered https://walling.app/ enjoyed what it offers and bought a sub. Have I made a mistake? I want to be able to use Walling with Drafts and looked here for tips etc. Couldn&#39;t find anything... but I saw there is support for Notion. A look at Notion suggests it could be all that Walling is and more especially as it integrates with Drafts?  Has anyone any thoughts they would care to share? Thanks Andy</description>

            <p>Thanks for this. I use Text Sniper assiduously, copy and paste together with Alfred is super helpful. If I could automate some of the tasks I regularly perform that would be even better. Having invested time and effort into Walling I’m not in a rush to move out!</p>

            <p>Scanning through their website, I don’t see anything about an API or any other ways for third parties to interact with the service. That often means you have to resort to copy and paste; so I’ not seeing anything obvious about how you could really use Drafts with it.</p>
<p>This is the position Notion has been in for a very long time. Their API is a very new addition and so is is only recently that Drafts can start to truly integrate with it for things like creating new content.</p>
