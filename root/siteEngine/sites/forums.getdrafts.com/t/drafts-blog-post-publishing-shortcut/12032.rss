    <title>Drafts blog post publishing shortcut</title>

    <description>If you’re like me and you use Drafts for writing blog posts and you have an SSG or other system that makes use of GitHub actions to pull in updates and recompile your site, you might enjoy this demonstration of a shortcut of mine. I use Working Copy to handle getting the post and any images into the repo, commit and push, and make sure any other branches in the repo get updated as well.

There’s also a demonstration of my Drafts Post Photo shortcut that lets me pick and choose images, puts a copy in the Drafts images preview folder, and inserts the markdown in the draft for me.
