    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/national-characters-in-groceries-action/11633</link>
    <description>Hello.

Total newbie at Drafts, but I am really, really impressed!

I downloaded and installed the &quot;Groceries&quot; action from the Drafts Directory to be able to add items to my grocery list in the Grocery app, but when entering items with Swedish characters, like &quot;å&quot;, &quot;ä&quot; and &quot;ö&quot; they are changed to Unicode (?) and looks like this:

&quot;Fläsk&quot; (pork in Swedish) becomes &quot;Fl%C3%A4sk&quot;
&quot;Kött&quot; (meat in Swedish) becomes &quot;K%C3%B6tt&quot;
&quot;Tvål&quot; (soap in Swedish) becomes &quot;Tv%C3%A5l&quot;

I would really appreciate some tips in how to fix this. I looked through previous posts, but didn&#39;t find anything that fixes the problem.

Looking forward to learn more about Drafts and will likely go for the Pro version soon!

Thank You!

            <p>Thanks for your reply! I totally understand! Worth mentioning is that I made some kind of workaround with your “List in Reminders”-action since I went for the Pro-version. This pretty much does the same thing when changing the list to the one configured in the Grocery app (which relies on Reminders). I was just curious to hear if you got any response from them. Thank you for a fantastic app by the way!</p>

            <p>This looks like a problem on Grocery’s end not un-encoding URL parameters properly.  I happen to know the developer of Grocery and will reach out to him with some examples of the problem.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it appears Grocery has good Shortcuts support, so something could be put together using Shortcuts instead.</p>
