    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/syntax-summary-counts-for-your-entire-draft-library/10372</link>
    <description>Hello,

Is there an action that can summarize the number of drafts by syntax? Something similar to this one for [summary and tag counts](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-get-a-summary-and-tag-counts-for-your-entire-draft-library/7490).</description>

            <p>Very late with this reply, but thank you <a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/sylumer">@sylumer</a>. The aforementioned action answers my question.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1aM" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ThoughtAsylum Action Group</a> looks powerful–and intimidating. Respect for the time you spent building it for your needs, maintaining, and sharing here.</p>

            <p>There are several tables all in a standard HTML formatted output. Copying the HTML should just be copying what I generate in the Action.</p>
<p>If you are getting the results back okay as rendered HTML from Marked 2, I think that suggests an issue with the preview window.</p>

            <p>Hi! I tried to run this action, but I only get name of the sections. I assume there should be a table, but VoiceOver says “1 Columns, 0 Rows”. For testing purposes, I copied results as HTML and previewed with Marked 2 and there was numbers and stats.<br>
So action works, just not displays any information for VoiceOver.</p>

            <p>The latest version of the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1ct">ThoughtAsylum - Power User</a> action group’s <code>TAD-Display Drafts Counts</code> action now includes a section that breaks down the count by syntax.</p>
<p>For info, the summary report it produces has tables of counts in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic counts (flagged, not flagged, and total) for inbox, archive, all, trash, and total.</li>
<li>Tag counts (flagged, not flagged, inbox, archive, total, and trashed) for each tag.</li>
<li>Syntax counts (all, trash, and total) for each syntax.</li>
<li>Version counts for total and most versions of a single draft.</li>
<li>Workspace counts (flagged, not flagged, inbox, archive, total, and trashed) for each workspace.</li>
<li>Actions &amp; groups
<ul>
<li>Count of groups</li>
<li>Count of actions</li>
<li>Count of sections</li>
<li>Count of actions and sections by action group</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
