- [**App Store**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id327630330?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Cf&amp;ct=directory)

[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) is a file storage service. Drafts offers direct integration with Dropbox through several methods.

#### Dropbox Action Steps

[Dropbox action steps](http://getdrafts.com/actions/steps/dropbox) directly integrate with Dropbox through their API and are a powerful, flexible way to create, append and prepend to files anywhere in your Dropbox. Sample ready to use examples:

- [Save to Dropbox](http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1EU)
- [Append to Dropbox Journal](http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1EV)

Each of these action steps has fields to configure how the file is named, the path (folder) it will be placed in and the content of the resulting file. See the [Dropbox action step](https://getdrafts.com/actions/steps/dropbox) documentation for more information on available fields.

#### Export and Import through Files

The Dropbox app provides integration through iOS 11 Files app. With the Dropbox app installed on your iOS device, files can be imported by tapping and holding the &quot;+&quot; new draft button in the editor, and selecting &quot;Import file&quot;.

Also the Drafts [Export action step](http://getdrafts.com/actions/steps/export) allows saving to arbitrary destinations in the Files app, including Dropbox.

#### Scripting

Drafts scripts can also read from and write to files in Dropbox using the [Dropbox](https://github.com/agiletortoise/drafts-documentation/wiki/Dropbox) object, and using it&#39;s advanced methods access the entire Dropbox API - including Dropbox Paper, list files, generating share links and more.  See the documentation for details, or start with these sample actions:

- [Send to Dropbox Paper](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1NE)
- [Save to Dropbox &amp; Create Share Link](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1NF)

#### Screencast

Although it covers Drafts 4, [this screencast by David Sparks](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-dropbox-with-drafts/20) covers using Dropbox actions and most of the action configuration tips still apply to Drafts 5.</description>
