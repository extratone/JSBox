    <title>Link Mode reference Local Assets</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/link-mode-reference-local-assets/9385</link>
    <description>Is there a way yet, for us to reference local assets by tapping a link in Link Mode? For example, I have a PDF file in `iCloud Drive/Drafts/Previews/Reference/some_file.pdf`. If I reference it as an image `![img](Reference/some_file.pdf)` and render it in Preview, it will display. But if I want to just have a link to the file without going to the preview, I can’t simply tap on it and have it open in Files or preview directly. I need to use the HTML Preview of the container page first before I can open it.

Context, I want to be able to use Drafts as a full on reference system and I’m almost there, I just need to be able to open reference attachments quickly and easily.</description>
