    <description>I really like the idea of @nahumck &#39;s Process Meeting Notes action, but I&#39;m wondering if anyone knows how to change it so task-prefixed (- [ ] ) items go to Things instead of Todoist?

            <p>You can leverage the script here for sending it to Reminders. Forgot that I had this!</p>

            <p>Hi, many thanks for all this, it is really helpful!  I’m new to Draft Pro and following all great work on the forum.  I was wondering if there is a way to sent the notes from the Meeting to Reminders, instead of Things or Todoist?.</p>
<p>The workflow I am using is:  1-Shortcut extracts all meetings in a given day, 2-sends a draft to Drafts, I then 3- process the meeting notes including actions, 4- the meeting note is then sent to Obsidian for filing , the missing step 5th is to send the tasks (from within the meeting note) to Reminders</p>

            <p>HI. I can’t figure out how to get Drafts to remove "- [ ] " when it sends to Things. It is annoying to have to do it with every todo when it arrives in Things. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I haven’t tested it, but I’ve updated it here with code that I know works. I don’t know why I had to reupload it, but I did have some spring cleaning issues earlier. So here’s the latest action, which includes both Todoist and Things. More could be added, but I’m lazy! <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
<p>I would have tested it, but I don’t have Things or Todoist installed.</p>

            <p>Yes, this is totally possible. You just need to build a callback url to add the tasks to Things.</p>
<p>If i have time tomorrow, I’ll post the code you’d need to add.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure that’s possible without a whole bunch more work. Have you found an API for Teams that includes adding tasks? (My firm’s Teams does not include any task-managment feature.)</p>
<p>Are the tasks the same as they would be in Outlook? I just wonder if there’s some other access point that you could write to.</p>
