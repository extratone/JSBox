    <title>Send Draft to Asana</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/send-draft-to-asana/12393</link>
    <description>I work in a team and use Asana and Drafts. I want to be able to send a draft to Asana, with fields from the draft that feed into it (i.e. task, project, due date, assignee). I see few if any posts about Asana at all. Can someone help guide me?</description>

            <p>Drafts does not have an special integration with Asana.</p>
<p>It should be possible to create actions that interface with Asana using <a href="https://asana.com/guide/help/api/api">there API</a> from script, if you have specific needs to set multiple values, etc. I have not seen any examples to point you to, but should be possible with HTTP scripting.</p>
<p>Asana also has an interface to <a href="https://asana.com/guide/help/email/email-to-asana">email tasks</a>, which should work well with Drafts <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/system#mail">email actions steps</a>. Would be easy to setup with actions pre-addressed to the right recipients - but is likely limited on the values you can set.</p>
<p>The third option would be to use an web-based automation tool that has Asana integration to bridge the gap – like <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a> or <a href="https://www.integromat.com">Integromat</a>. Both support web-hooks to trigger actions. There’s an example of calling web-hooks in our <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-zapier-with-drafts/608">Zapier integration guide</a>.</p>
