    <title>Drafts 5 on Mac - Send current note to Typora.app</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-5-on-mac-send-current-note-to-typora-app/9262</link>
    <description>Howdy!  Long-time user first post:  
- Looking for the most direct route to send the current Drafts note to a new Typora file via a single Drafts action (Mac only).  
- Trying to avoid having to ‚Äúshare then select app,‚Äù as Typora is my primary MD editor.  

Where I‚Äôm at in general:  
- I have 20-30 actions on Drafts iOS that I mostly use to create MD docs in pre-defined folders or prepend text to pre-defined MD docs.  (target = dropbox)  
- I have experience with Automator and Keyboard Maestro. 
- Some experience with Applescript, URL schemes and shell scripts.  
- Not familiar with JS for automation.  

I‚Äôm probably just missing something, so any advice or FAQ-pointing-out appreciated.  I‚Äôm up to try anything required for the one-click or one-keycommand functionality.  

Thanks for reading ü§ò</description>
