    <description>This is a bit of a basic question. How do I open a second editor window in Draft for Mac which I can edit and save under a different name? 

&#39;Open in new window&#39; replicates the first, but how do I make it a version?

Sorry if I&#39;m missing something obvious. I&#39;ve been locked down for too long...</description>

            <p>A further note which may be relevant: the duplicated draft will <em>not</em> have the same history as the original.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you started with <code>longversion.md</code> and duplicated it to <code>shortversion.md</code> and then did your editing, but then wanted to retrieve a paragraph from an earlier version of the original, you won’t find it in the history of <code>shortversion.md</code> but will have to go back to <code>longversion.md</code>.</p>

            <p>A new window is essentially a new <em>view</em> of the <em>same</em> draft, so I think what you’re looking for is, <code>File &gt; Duplicate</code> then open the duplicate in a new window, where you can see both drafts alongside.</p>
<p>(As an aside, I find opening a new view on the draft can be useful with multiple desktops as I can leave my main Drafts window on its usual screen while editing the specific draft on another screen, alongside the thing I’m making notes about. Very handy!)</p>

            <p>I think in that case maybe you just want to open a new window and then CMD+N to load a new draft into it.</p>

            <p>My wrong terminology… about saving as a version. What I want to do is to work on essentially two different docs so I have something like e.g.  longversion.md and shortversion.md.</p>

            <p>I think you want to duplicate the draft (check the actions directory) not create another version. Versions are a history of changes to a Draft and Draft show your the current version unless you specifically opt to start scanning back. Whatever you update becomes the latest and replaces the previous.</p>
