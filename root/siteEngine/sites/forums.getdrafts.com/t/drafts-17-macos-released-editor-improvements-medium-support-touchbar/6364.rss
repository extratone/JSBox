    <title>Drafts 17 (macOS) Released - Editor improvements, Medium support, TouchBar</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-17-macos-released-editor-improvements-medium-support-touchbar/6364</link>
    <description>Drafts 17 (macOS) has been released [in the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1435957248?mt=12&amp;at=11l4Cf&amp;ct=site), details below.

_(Also, see [what&#39;s new in the iOS version](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-17-ios-released-editor-improvements-medium-support-and-more/6365))_

### Editor Improvements

- **Highlight insertion point option to draw different background for current cursor position**.
- **Editor setting to limit max characters per line**. Works along with margin settings to determine a maximum line length. Great for use with full screen mode to prevent excessively long lines.
- For more details, see [editor settings docs](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/editorsettings.html)

### Other Additions

- **&quot;Run Action&quot; option in drafts list contextual menu**. Allows action to be run on multiple selected drafts. Select drafts and right-click to access.
- **TouchBar support** (when available). Uses same configuration options as [Action Bar](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/action-bar.html) (but can display different action group).
- **Two new monochrome editor themes**. Available to select in `File &gt; Editor Preferences...`
- `Medium` action step type to post to Medium.com. [Docs](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services.html#medium)
- `Medium` script object to support scripting Medium API. [Docs](https://scripting.getdrafts.com/classes/medium.html)
- Script steps now have a new &quot;Allow asynchronous execution&quot; option. When enabled, the action will wait for a call to `script.complete()` to know if a script step is finished. This allows use of async/await, Promises and other async function calls...but your script *must* call `script.complete()` of the action will timeout and fail after 60 seconds.
- `CallbackURL` objects have a read-only `url` property to debug the URL which will be used with the configured parameters.

### Other Fixes and Changes

- **Fix:** Hiding action group from list should not remove it from main menu.
- **Fix:** `Filemanager.readString` would not return undefined properly when file was not found.
- **Fix:** Inaccurate action directory URLs used for opening actions posted to the directory.
- **Fix:** Appending to a flagged draft from the capture window could unflag the draft.
- Misc. additional fixes and stability improvements.

            <p>No short term plans to implement. It would require re-architecting the capture window into an entirely separate app which ads a lot of complexity and would limit some of the other functionality I have planned for it.</p>
