    <description>I&#39;m working on prioritizing a round of general usability improvements and changes. I&#39;d like to hear about what would help you most using Drafts (on iOS) day to day. 

I don&#39;t want to hear about services to integrate, or how to completely re-design the UI, but little annoyances &amp; foibles or simple additions that would make the app smoother and easier for you for normal day to day use.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,<br>
When working on a long draft (e.g. more than 200 lines ; iPhone 8), switching to another app and coming back to Drafts very often displays the beginning of the draft with keyboard disabled. I have to either scroll down or tap the Navigate button to go back to the draft bottom and continue writing. Very annoying.<br>
Thanks for this thread <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>You could assign set CTRL+TAB and SHFT+TAB to the existing default indent and outdent actions (defaults are CMD+] and CMD+[ respectively - as discussed earlier in this thread).</p>
<p>But I do note that by default on iPadOS, SHIFT+TAB is switching me back and forth between editor entry and tag entry in Drafts.</p>

</aside>
<p>Indent and outdent are actions, hence their availability on the actions keyboard row. Once the Mac app supports actions, these should work.</p>
<p>Based on his posts here and on the Slack channel, Greg is still working on this, and I believe a beta version with some level of action support will be available once the i*OS13 churn settles down and he can finish getting everything lined up ready for such a test.</p>

<p>Drafts ships with indent/outdent actions in the “Keyboard-Basic” group assigned to the external keyboard shortcuts <code>⌘-[</code> and <code>⌘-]</code> - which are common shortcuts for indent/outdent in many text editors. I know you mentioned knowing about these, but adding explanation for others.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hi folks, I’m usually lurking and reading a ton of posts, but not active on the posting side myself.</p>
<p>Is the Drafts Keyboard Basic outdent and intent available on Drafts for MacOS?</p>
<p>I am converting from using Quip, Google Docs, Evernote, and many other apps/services to Drafts and am trying to figure out how to remap the TAB key to indent and SHIFT+TAB to outdent in Drafts on MacOS.</p>
<p>I use these on my iPad and iPhone al the time, but can’t seem to find “actions” on the MacOS version.  I’m guessing that it’s not available based on other content I’ve read, but I wanted to ask, just in case I overlooked something.</p>
<p>I guess I could use KeybardMaestro to do it, but wasn’t sure if this was built into the app itself.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On an external keyboard, when using the down arrow to move through a list of drafts, it would be really good if you could move further down (i.e., scroll through) than only what’s shown on screen. This is particularly confusing as the “active draft” keeps changing when you’ve gone down below the bottom of the screen. Keyboard support is otherwise great, but this for me, sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is something I’d love to see addressed as well. It’s often the only reason I need to take my hands off the keyboard. Scrolling with Up/Down works on the the Action List perfectly.</p>

            <p>I am a researcher who frequently extracts citable or quotable material from sources available on Kindle and Questia. I can share to Drafts from both sources but still have to manually provide citation information, e.g., in APA style “Bowman (2007: 53).” If Drafts could do that automatically, it would be an enormous help.</p>

            <p>On tapping <code>Select</code> the text changes to <code>Cancel</code>, but after selecting a bunch of drafts and performing an operation on them, it is slightly unintuitive that it remains as <code>Cancel</code> rather than <code>Done</code>. To me, “cancel” means to back out of the process without affecting anything. If this is an easy change to make it would remove a small point of friction.</p>

            <p>Yes, I understand there are different needs between people for an app such as Drafts. I don’t know how all you other people use Drafts in your workflow. But in any case, the workflow to get to a tappable link currently is often so complex, including opening or closing panels, then switching to the link mode, then back, that I often find it’s easier to just copy and paste the link to the browser. I see the core of Drafts is to get rid of this kind of repetition through automation. This is the case for some easier way to get to the links in the editing mode.</p>
<p>The hiding of links is perhaps another related suggestion that could be useful for some users, As a usecase, I created an indented checklist of hiking item considerations, and the appended links sometimes took multiple lines of text, making the simple checklist quite convoluted.</p>
<p>Just some things to consider in this kind of an app with multiple kind of users and needs. <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>For what it’s worth, hiding the URL would not be a good change for me. I need to see the full URL where various links in the same draft are to the same site/app.</p>
<p>If there was an option to enable such a change in behaviour that may be something some would want, but personally, I wouldn’t want to have hiding parts of URLs as the default Markdown format behaviour.</p>

            <p>Yes, something like that. For instance, the Bear app has done it quite nicely in my opinion. For instance, the named links such as <code>[My favourite discussion](http://whatever.com/wherever/43434343434</code> shows just the named link “My favourite discussion”. In my workflow at least it’s very rare that I want to modify the links after they’re inserted, unless I’d be working with some x-callback url magic. Most of the time at max I’d want to modify the name of the link, which is also rare. Most of the time I want to go to where the link points to. In practical use I’m not also interested in seeing the often very long links to the website that relate only to that website’s specific functionality. It can result in a great amount of clutter to just have the link there. I like having the links in Markdown format, but the ui could perhaps hide some of the clutter for most used scenarios, then maybe require double tap or cursor movement if you do the more rare thing such as actually modify the link. The check buttons in todo lists already give some kind of actionability over the Markdown syntax. Thoughs?</p>

            <p>I’d suggest say some sort of long press, or alternative to activate something like that.  I tap around my screen to position the cursor whilst editing, including for on URLs for modifying those URLs. I’d rather not tap on a URL to edit it and have it launch a browser. But, in my opinion, a tap and hold, or other less overriding option, would be practical and beneficial.</p>

            <p>I often collect links for reference, etc when working on a Draft. It often seems inconvenient to go back and forth the editing mode and the link mode in this type of use. It would be useful if you could just click the link in the editing mode as well. It works quite well in several other Markdown editors.</p>

            <p>The Next and Previous buttons in the bottom toolbar are inconvenient when the keyboard is visible.</p>
<p>For example: I frequently capture lots of stuff and then have a long list of Drafts to process or tag. An improved workflow:  Tap tag button → Type tag and maybe edit draft → Hit down button → repeat without having to hide the keyboard to get to the down button.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I remembered one more: a script method for pinning the draft or action drawer. this would make loading a workspace + action group even better.</p>

<p>I’m 99.9% sure that’s something we need the Shortcuts team to implement - I have filed a radar on that, and if you’re not on a beta iOS I suggest you go to <a href="http://apple.com/feedback" rel="nofollow noopener">apple.com/feedback</a> to let them know you’d like to see it too <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Also, I don’t know how small this is, but I’d love to see the Shortcuts integration of Drafts include the ability to add tags to a draft. Currently, I think the only way to do that is to use the good ol’ x-callback-url. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Maybe this is just me, but perhaps there could be some UI tweaks to better identify options with workspaces. I like the concept, but how to set up a new workspace does not appear to be as obvious as it could be.</p>
