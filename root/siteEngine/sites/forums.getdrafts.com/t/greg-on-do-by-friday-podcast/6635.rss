    <description>**[UPDATE:]** Probably should be clear that Do By Friday is a NSFW humor podcast. Be prepared for language.

For those interested in such things, I was a guest to discuss Drafts on this week&#39;s episode of the &quot;Do By Friday&quot; challenge podcast with Merlin Mann, Max Temkin and Alex Cox:

            <p>I’ve had a ScreenCastsOnline account for several years. I wrote Don a few weeks ago and told him that what I found more useful than watching the weekly videos was being able to go back and look at past ones. Many is the time I have found a new app or become interested in one and he had already done the screencast. It’s value was: 1) deciding if I could really use the app before I bought it; 2) an excellent tutorial after I bought it; and 3) finding apps I had never considered. Finding Notion was a good example of <span class="hashtag">#3</span>. I almost didn’t watch it because I thought I wasn’t interested in it. Now, Notion has essentially replaced Evernote for me.</p>

            <p>Don McAllister has done several screencasts on Drafts, including a recent update for the new Mac version. Just go to <a href="http://screencastsonline.com" rel="nofollow noopener">ScreenCastsOnline</a> and search for Drafts. If you’re not a member, there is a free trial period that will let you watch the tutorial. However, you’re missing a lot by not having a membership.</p>

            <p>Well, I really enjoyed the episode.</p>
<p>However, I learned something about myself: I cannot follow tech instructions just by listening to people talk on a podcast. I was completely lost trying to understand what was being said.</p>
<p>For example, the grocery list thing is something I would love to utilize, but I have no idea how to do it.</p>
<p>I find myself wishing there was a video tutorial for Drafts, because I know I’m using like 0.5% of what it can do.</p>

<p>A <em>very</em> rudimentary thing I do is write all iMessages in Drafts. It’s just a much better place to compose and I no longer accidentally send unedited or incomplete texts.</p>

            <p>Would have appreciated <strong>DBF</strong> more if they actually gave You time to talk; not really the DBF Schtick, maybe. The language didn’t seem <em>that</em> egregious, but unless you like the humor, you’ll find it, at least this show, pretty random…</p>
<p>Then I listened to <strong>MPU</strong> and got to actually learn some things about Drafts and it’s creation, what it looks like on a daily basis, equipment used, etc. Cool.</p>

            <p>On the 75% is built on what came before, I’d say that’s a characteristic not a problem.</p>
<p>For example, Accidental Tech Podcast has this characteristic (as does my MUCH smaller podcast series). “Knowingness” can be intimidating to new listeners but it has a binding effect.</p>
<p>Still, with DBF you probably have to be of a certain mindset to enjoy it. I happen to be of that mindset… <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I can understand your points but since Drafts has achieved cult status I listened devoutly to the Greg part (but was interrupted by a call from a professor emeritus in robotics who uses to start his more than hour long calls with: “Let’s just have a short conversation…” First one of my airpods died, then problem with the other one, finally the iPhone shut down in the middle of the call and had only 1% charge left).</p>
<p>Since I still haven’t heard the rest of the pod I can’t compare which of these competing stimuli was the best. May be it’s safest to finish this post with</p>

            <p>Most of the humor comes from having listen to &gt;75% of the previous shows. That said I get why it might not be everyone’s cup of tea. I have to say the thing I took from this one is trying to build the grocery setup that <a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/agiletortoise">@agiletortoise</a> describes in here. I’m building the template and have added the mode for locking the screen on. RIP battery though.</p>

            <p>It’s certainly not for everyone. I probably should have mentioned the NSFW nature of the podcast up front.  If you aren’t keen on the DBF brand of humor, you might prefer my <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/gregs-on-mpu-this-week/6410">recent appearance on Mac Power Users</a>.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I’m not a fan of the podcast either. I heard it once before when he was on it a long time ago, and I never went back to it. I appreciate Greg’s hard work on Drafts, and it’s great to hear his thoughts on Drafts and any story around Drafts. Thank you for posting the time Greg begins to speak.</p>

            <p>Some of us like those “potty mouthed brats”. (Not to be argumentative.)</p>
<p>I’ve yet to hear the episode but I think it’s got a lot to do with Alex getting into Drafts.</p>

            <p>good grief, that is probably the worst “podcast” I have ever heard. Nothing but potty mouthed brats. Greg’s interview starts at near 48 minutes in.<br>
The first 48 unites is a total waste of time.</p>

            <p><strong>[UPDATE:]</strong> Probably should be clear that Do By Friday is a NSFW humor podcast. Be prepared for language.</p>
<p>For those interested in such things, I was a guest to discuss Drafts on this week’s episode of the “Do By Friday” challenge podcast with Merlin Mann, Max Temkin and Alex Cox:</p>
