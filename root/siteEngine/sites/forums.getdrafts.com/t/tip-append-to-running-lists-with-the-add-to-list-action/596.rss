    <title>TIP: Append to running lists with the &quot;Add to list&quot; action</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-append-to-running-lists-with-the-add-to-list-action/596</link>
    <description>This example action demonstrates a method to create and append to running lists in Drafts. Useful for things like capturing movies you want to see, or things you need to remember to pick up at the store.

Get the action and more details [at the Action Directory](http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Ga), see it in action below.

A few basic modifications at the top of the action script control what categories are available to select for lists and the tag to use to assign new lists.</description>

            <p>This action is working great for me.  I have one more wish - is it possible for the draft that I am pulling the selection from to stay as the current draft even after the selection is made and moved to the list (I generally have several selections that I make from a single draft)?  I appreciate the help.  I am really enjoying drafts.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/sylumer">@sylumer</a>’s suggestion is great, but I might suggest a slight tweak. If you replace the line he called out with the below, the action would continue to work both ways, because the <code>[[selection]]</code> template tag returns the full text of the draft if their is no current selection – therefore you would not need two separate actions for use on full text versus current selection:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// grab current draft
const currentContent = draft.processTemplate("[[selection]]");
</code></pre>

            <p>Yes, this is certainly possible. Rather than referencing the <code>content</code> property of a draft, you would reference the selected text of the editor.</p>
<p>Try changing this code in the original action…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">// grab current draft
const currentContent = draft.content.trim();
</code></pre>
<p>…to this…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">// grab current draft text selection
const currentContent = editor.getSelectedText().trim();
</code></pre>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>Is there a way to “Add to List” a selection as opposed to a full draft?  Sometimes I have taken notes and just want a selection from my notes added to a list.</p>

            <p>One thing you can do is use TextExpander. They have a lot of default date formats. For example, the one I use is <em>dld</em>. That gives me <em>20210328</em>, which is the date format I prefer for filing. However, there are a lot of others with their own shortcuts.</p>

            <p>You can’t trigger an action from checking an inline check box, but you could use an action to check the box on the current line and append the date to the end. You could keep it on your action bar (above the keyboard) for easy access.</p>

        <title>TIP: Append to running lists with the &quot;Add to list&quot; action</title>

            <p>Hi - This worked great for me for a while - not sure what I did, but now when I try to add something to a list, it creates a NEW list whose only item is the Draft just acted upon…<br>
Any thoughts what might be causing this? I’m suspecting it may have something to do w the fact that the old lists have been archived; so when I go to add to them, it creates a new list in the Inbox; however, I don’t want the lists sitting in my Inbox… but rather out of sight, out of mind…<br>
Any help would be welcomed!</p>

            <p>Can you add in the description and code comments that to identify a list, the set tag (e.g. lists) and <code>## header</code> is required?</p>
<p>Thanks for the fork!</p>

            <p>I updated my tweaked version of this action:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>new</strong> Add option to append or prepend items to a list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect list names from tagged drafts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create new lists inside the action.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <p>No heading so that’s not a problem but some idea of how to modify the script to prepend would be good.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Yes, it’s certainly possible to alter the script to put new list items at the top.  A little more complex if you want to maintain the heading, since the script would have to local the right insertion point, not just tack text on the top.</p>
<p>Not restoring the last cursor position is a bug in the current release which will be fixed in the next update.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Is there a way to adapt this script to prepend rather than append text to an existing draft? I keep a running list of favourite quotes with the most recent at the top. At the moment when I open the draft each time and the cursor default to the end of the text. I’ve had a look but coding isn’ t my strong point!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>You know what I’d like here? I’d like the action to turn each listed item into a tappable link to search Google or Duck Duck Go so when I later come back to the list it’s easy to look up whatever the thing is.</p>
