    <title>Search for draft and append based on title</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/search-for-draft-and-append-based-on-title/12110</link>
    <description>Each day I create a Journal entry that catches all my day&#39;s comments, notes, etc.  The title each day is pretty straightforward.  &quot;Journal 2022-02-16&quot; for example.

I would like to create a shortcut on IOS so I can simply dictate an item and have it appended to the bottom of the Journal.  I&#39;ve successfully built a shortcut that will always put the entry in a pre-defined note... but I don&#39;t see a way to find and append to a note matching the title criteria.

Any help is appreciated.</description>

            <p>Nope… EXACTLY like that.  I wasn’t aware of the search function in drafts working that way.  Perfect.</p>
<p>I can’t express how much I appreciate that.  You are very kind.</p>
