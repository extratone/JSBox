    <title>List of tasks in NotePlan?</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/list-of-tasks-in-noteplan/12565</link>
    <description>Hi there! I am considering moving to NotePlan 3 as my Task Management system, since I am a Setapp subscriber. There are a couple of NotePlan actions and action groups in the directory, however I can&#39;t find any action that will take a list of items and turn them into separate tasks in NotePlan. Does anybody have any suggestion on how to accomplish this? Thanks!</description>
