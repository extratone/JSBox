    <description>Links to Scrivener documents work perfectly, (Scrivener→ document → copy link → paste into draft) but I am unable to create links to external files like numbers files. I am not referring to opening draft content in numbers. I just want to open a numbers file in my mac. In terms of workflow, I tried all finder → file → copy path possible including Unix, HFS, Terminal and most importantly URL.
thank you</description>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You could create an action with a <code>Run AppleScript</code> step and add the Keyboard Maestro code from the macro you want to run.  It might looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">on execute(draft)
	tell application "Keyboard Maestro Engine"
		do script "26BFEDCE-EAC3-4F46-9252-4F6861072243"
	end tell
end execute
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could use the <code>URL</code> action step and the URL trigger for the Keyboard Maestro macro.</p>
<p>e.g. The macro above is triggered by <code>kmtrigger://macro=26BFEDCE-EAC3-4F46-9252-4F6861072243</code></p>

<p>If you want <strong>a way to insert a link to a local file in a Draft</strong>, and then have that file open, you can also try the Hook app (<a href="https://hookproductivity.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://hookproductivity.com/</a>). It will very quickly “expose” and copy the link to any local file (or web page, etc), which you can then paste anywhere. It’s a Mac-only app, but it goes a long way to helping with this.</p>
<p>P.S. I sort-of work for the developer of Hook, so grain-of-salt, of course.</p>

            <p>thank you for your Post and the info.<br>
Would you have any idea if this solution would. be applicable to images ?<br>
Working in a scientific field on notes without images (or at least links to images) in this day and age is (for me at least) extremely difficult.<br>
The images (or links to images) have to be visible (active links) in both iOS and Mac OS<br>
thanks again</p>

            <p>Hi, all…</p>
<p>I have been playing around with this very topic for Drafts for Mac. I wanted to link to some PDFs so what I did is put them in an iCloud folder and then create the shared links and then used the Markup link feature to share them. I followed the instructions <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/share-files-with-icloud-file-sharing-mchl91854a7a/mac" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. It works well.</p>

            <p>Funny thing: I could not make the URL file link work and was looking for alternative ways to open the file.</p>
<p>I created a keyboard maestro macro to open the file (takes 2 seconds) and pasted the macro URL into drafts. Not only does it work to open a file, I can now turbo charge drafts Mac by inserting links to trigger any keyboard maestro macro which opens up a whole new world of functionalities.</p>

I am doing exactly the same thing as you, but I don’t even get as far as the file in finder. When I click on the link in link mode nothing happens. I have spent the day trying in vain to figure out why. I am definitely in link mode: links turn blue and both scrivener document and Evernote note links work perfectly</p>

            <p>I had a look at this yesterday, but copying the URL to open in Finder was as far as I could get; I hadn’t thought this was far enough and couldn’t find (or guess) a workable URL scheme for Numbers.</p>
<p>For me, if I copy the URL from PathFinder, paste it into Drafts, switch Drafts to link mode and click on the link in the Draft, Finder opens and the file whose URL I entered is automatically selected within the Finder listing.</p>
<p>For reference, I’m currently running the public version of Drafts on Mac (not the beta today) on Mojave.</p>

            <p>no, nothing happens if I click on the file URLs. I click and my cursor stays on the link in drafts. Nothing happens. It does not even show the file in Finder. If it did, I would accept the limitation (just one Return away from opening the file - a minor incumbrance) and stop bothering you.</p>

            <p>Well, it opens the URLs, right?  Just show the file in Finder. I think that’s all you can do at the moment…unless you are working with apps that support their own URL schemes, like Scrivener.</p>

            <p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>I am going bananas trying to figure this out.</p>
<p>From the start,  I did exactly as you describe. My problem is that the file URL links (screenshot of Pathfinder) are not functional. Below are attempts with docx, png and pdf files.</p>
<p>I tried many times, with many different drafts and files before disturbing you with this question.</p>
<p>The same file links work perfectly if I paste them and click on them in a Scrivener document.</p>
<hr>
<p>The only non web site links that work perfectly in Drafts for Mac are links to Scrivener documents.</p>
<hr>
<p>thank you</p>

            <p>You would need the file’s URL, which could be placed in a draft and would work in <a href="https://getdrafts.com/editor/linkmode" rel="nofollow noopener">link mode</a> to open that file/folder. File URLs are in the format <code>file:///path/to/file</code>. So, <code>file:///Users/</code> would open the “Users” folder in Finder.</p>
<p>I don’t know if there’s an easy way to get those in Finder…you might need to set something up with an automation tool to easily construct them from a selection. For many files it would just be a matter of putting the <code>file://</code> before the path - but other paths might require proper URL encoding.</p>

            <p>Links to Scrivener documents work perfectly, (Scrivener→ document → copy link → paste into draft) but I am unable to create links to external files like numbers files. I am not referring to opening draft content in numbers. I just want to open a numbers file in my mac. In terms of workflow, I tried all finder → file → copy path possible including Unix, HFS, Terminal and most importantly URL.<br>
thank you</p>
