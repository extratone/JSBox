    <description>Hey Everyone!

I’m travel a lot for work and one thing I’m doing right now is creating an Apple Note for every city I’m in with “subcategories” (okay they’re bolded words) for Resturants, Bars, Brunch places, whatever cool thing I might find. I would love to be able to automate this in Drafts and just type in a place and have an action ask what note to put it in/create a new city, and then ask what subcategory to place under that heading. 

Is something like this possible?

Thanks in advance!</description>

            <p>Using JavaScript, you can definitely parse, plunder and rebuild any Draft in the archive to suit your needs.</p>
<p>Find the Draft you need to update. Get it’s content. If the heading you want isn’t there add it and the new details.  If it is there then just insert it into that section. Appending a new line followed by the new detail to the sub heading is probably the easiest way.</p>

            <p>Keep it all in Drafts, I saw that note and it’s didappointing but maybe one day! Drafts sits in my dock anyway so it makes sense to keep it there, I would prefer to have the note sit in the Archieves though so that it doesn’t appear on my inbox badges.</p>
<p>I feel like it should be possible, I just don’t know if it’s able to splice and insert based on the subcategories. Right now I’m thinking of having “## Title” and then just “# subcategory” for the arguments to search on.</p>

This is a short article, but we do get asked often how to integrate with the built-in Apple Notes app.  Unfortunately, at this time, Apple does not provide ways to integrate with Notes that would allow more direct, interaction-free integration with third party apps.  Currently, content can be sent to Apple Notes via its Share extension. 
Use the <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1BF">Share</a> action, which comes in the default “Basic” action group and select the “Notes” app.  From this share extension, the draft text can be add…
