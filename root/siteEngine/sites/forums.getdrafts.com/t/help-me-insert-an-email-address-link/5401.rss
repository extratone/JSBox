    <title>Help me insert an email address link</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/help-me-insert-an-email-address-link/5401</link>
    <description>I apologize in advance if this is obvious to others, but I have not been able to discern how to embed an email link in a draft.

I am using iOS on an iPad, and I publish an email newsletter using Apple Mail. I have tried a number of times to write a person’s name, and then add a link that, when activated, will start an email address to the person.

I have tried the syntax ” [Jimmy Jones] (jimmy@jones.com) “ and I have also tried 
[Jimmy Jones] (mailto:jimmy@jones.com), but neither syntax works in the preview or in markdown email. Note: I added the spaces between the [] and () after I saw that the forums software automatically rendered those as links. When in drafts, I omit the space! :grinning:

If this has already been answered either here in the forums or in the documentation, please just point me in the direction of that knowledge. Thanks!

            <p>Yes, your clarification works great.</p>
<p>I can’t figure out what I was doing wrong, but, with your help, I will certainly be successful going forward!</p>

            <p>If you are using a mail action that generates HTML, you would need the output of the template to include that as an html link, like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;a href="mailto:jimmyjones@domain.com"&gt;Send Jimmy Mail&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The easiest way to do that, is to use Markdown Mail which runs Markdown markup through a Markdown engine an converts it to HTML.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link">syntax for links</a> in Markdown is: <code>[text](url)</code>, so, for the Markdown Mail action you would need to have the below in your draft:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-markdown">[Send Jimmy Mail](mailto:jimmyjones@domain.com)
</code></pre>
<p>When running the Markdown mail action, that would get converted to the HTML <code>a</code> tag and be a clickable link in the resulting email.</p>
<p>Does that help clarify?</p>

            <p>My end goal is to have the text of my email contain a name, like Jimmy Jones, which contains a “mailto:” link, allowing the reader of the email to click the link and be brought to an email with Jimmy Jones as the addressee.</p>
<p>I have been able to type an email address into drafts, enter the link mode, and click the link to make the email address a tappable link, but I have not been able to export that tappable link to an email via either the “Email” or “markdown email” actions.</p>
<p>I feel like I am missing something obvious.</p>

            <p>Not sure I understand exactly what your end goal is…if it’s just to have link in the text of a draft you can tap to open a new message addressed in Mail, you can just place the email address in a draft, and enable <a href="https://getdrafts.com/editor/linkmode" rel="nofollow noopener">Link Mode</a> and the email address will become a tappable link.</p>
<p>If you are wanting to automate this further, you can create email actions already configured to sent to specific addresses or groups. The <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/sending-mail-with-drafts/3597">email integration guide</a> covers some of these basic of configuring mail actions.</p>
