    <title>Feature suggestion: Only disable spelling and gramma check in fenced code blocks</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/feature-suggestion-only-disable-spelling-and-gramma-check-in-fenced-code-blocks/4209</link>
    <description>Normally, when writing markdown I would like spelling and gramma check enabled,
but when I have to add some fenced cold blocks in the markdown, they are very likely
to trigger the spelling and gramma warnings due to arbitrary naming in programming:

In the picture above, *wrng word* in normal paragraph shows both spelling and gramma warning,
this is great and expected. But for the same word and the `GetWrngWord` in fenced code block,
I would like them to have no warnings.

I think this should be the default behavior, or at least there should be a
*disable spelling and gramma check in code blocks* option in the editor preference,
if you prefer diversity over uniformity.</description>

            <p>I ran into this today. It would be helpful to optionally disable spell/grammar check in both fenced code blocks and inline code.</p>
