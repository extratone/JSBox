    <title>Drafts and Shortcuts on iOS</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-and-shortcuts-on-ios/12280</link>
    <description>I’ve created a simple iOS Shortcut that appends a date/time stamp to a draft called “Log” in the background. 

I’d like to run it from Apple Watch, but every time I do I have to click on “Allow”. Is this what others are seeing?

(It works fine on iPhone/iPad: the “Allow” setting sticks).

This is rather annoying behavior for something that is supposed to be a “shortcut.”</description>

            <p>This an Apple issue. If there is a way around it, I’m not aware of it. It’s been happening a lot for all sorts of Shortcuts at least since iOS 15 / watchOS 8 came out. There’s a bunch of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/iwwaf8/apple_watch_always_asks_to_confirm_execution_of/">threads around the Internet</a> with complains about it.</p>
<p>Don’t think there’s anything you or Drafts could do to resolve.</p>
