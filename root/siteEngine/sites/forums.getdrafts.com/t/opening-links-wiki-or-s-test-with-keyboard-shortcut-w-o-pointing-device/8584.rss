    <title>Opening links [[wiki]] or [[s:test]] with keyboard shortcut (w/o pointing device)</title>

    <description>Hi all,

I am trying to build my workflow with Drafts and like it very much so far. In general I like to keep my hands at the keyboard, and Drafts seems to do ok supporting this.

Nevertheless I have found no way of opening links like [[s: test]] without a pointing device. I have found the &quot;open cross-link at cursor&quot; action, but this one seems to work only with the wiki-style links.

Do I miss an (easy) option?

Thanks for your support

            <p>Something that would cover this has been on my to-do list for a while.  I think I now have something that supports what you are looking for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TAD-Process Link</strong><br>
Taking the start of any selection as the cursor location, this action will attempt to identify any Markdown or wiki-style cross-link that the cursor is within. The action will then process that link as though it was a link the user had manually activated. If you favour the keyboard as your primary Drafts interaction device, consider creating an action that calls this one and assign it a keyboard shortcut.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The range of supported cross-links is explained in a key TADpoLe function it utilises -</em> <a href="https://tadpole.thoughtasylum.com/interfaces/app.html#ta_processcrosslink"><code>app.TA_processCrossLink</code></a>.</p>
<p>There’s a bit of processing in this that is slightly convoluted, so hopefully it will work well, but my testing is certainly far from infallible.</p>
<p>To use it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and set up the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1aM">ThoughtAsylum action group</a> and follow the set-up instructions (to have the action group get the latest TADpoLe code).</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1cv">ThoughtAsylum - Management action group</a> (<em>no set-up required for this one</em>).</li>
<li>Create a new action in your own group and assign it your preferred keyboard shortcut, name and icon.</li>
<li>Add a single step to your action - an <code>Include Action</code> step that includes the action <code>TAD-Process Link</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the <code>TAD-Process Link</code> action gets updated in the future and you update the action group, you will get to keep all your personalised settings for your own action without having to remake anything.</p>
<p>I hope that gives you a way forward <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/+1/2.png?v=9" title=":+1:t2:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t2:"></p>
