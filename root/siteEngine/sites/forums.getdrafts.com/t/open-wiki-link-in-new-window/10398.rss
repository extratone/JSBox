    <title>Open wiki link in new window</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/open-wiki-link-in-new-window/10398</link>
    <description>Would love to &quot;cmd-click&quot; (or whatever) on a wiki link to open it in a new window on Mac. I have some project files with several links in them and it would be awesome to be able to open this file, then cmd-click the several links. Right now I can open the draft in a new window, then click the wiki link, then go back to the original window and choose &quot;open in new window&quot; again, click the second wiki link, etc. A little tedious. Would also be great in other one-off cases.

Another approach that could be nice is [scripting the ability to open drafts in a new window](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/ability-in-script-to-open-draft-in-new-window/7250). That would work for my main project file use case (and possibly work well with window management software to arrange the window tiled nicely) and probably for the one-off cases if implemented as an action.</description>

            <p>I would request that cmd-click opens a link in general, not only wikilinks. Without being able to make a general statement, in my perception, it is becoming more and more a standard with markdown apps that cmd+click opens a link. (Obsidian, iA Writer, etc. have exactly this behavior)</p>
<p><em>(since it is a very similar feature request, I am posting this here instead of opening a new thread.)</em></p>

            <p>Curious- would “tabs” - like a browser be a part of the new window features?</p>

            <p>I do have somethings planned in this area, but they are dependent on a larger refactoring project so would hesitate to make speculations on the timeframe right now.</p>
