    <title>Problems with dictation</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/problems-with-dictation/5579</link>
    <description>First, it must be known that I&#39;m experiencing this on my iPad... which is running the beta of iOS 13... so not sure if that is the problem. The dictation seems to not be always working correctly. Most of the time it does. There are times that I will be dictating (e.g. using the not stopping feature you have... which I love) that it will sometimes just kick me out. It will seem like it loses the data... but sometimes it will insert it much later. I&#39;m using an iPad pro (not the newest... but should still be plenty fast). At first I though I was maybe accidentally hitting the screen (I was sitting and holding my iPad verses having it with the keyboard). Seems to be once every several times. 

Anyways, thanks for the great app... it by far is my most used app on my iOS devices.</description>
