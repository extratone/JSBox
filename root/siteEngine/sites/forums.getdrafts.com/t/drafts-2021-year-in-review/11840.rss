    <title>Drafts 2021: Year in Review</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-2021-year-in-review/11840</link>
    <description>2021 has been a busy year for Drafts. I am, generally speaking, a person who prefers to spend their time contemplating the present and future, but it&#39;s not a bad idea to look back now and then and remind yourself of what you have accomplished. 

In case you missed some of it, here are a few of the major features that have made their way into Drafts in 2021:

* [Custom Syntaxes and Themes](https://docs.getdrafts.com/extending/)
* [Google Task](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-google-task-with-drafts/10575) and [Microsoft To Do](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-drafts-with-microsoft-to-do/10574) Integration
* [Widget](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/widgets) Theming
* [Document Scanning and Live Text Support](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/document-scanning)
* [Folder Bookmarks](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/bookmarks)
* [Shortcuts Support on Mac](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/shortcuts)
* [New Apple Watch App](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/applewatch)
* [Auto-Complete for `[[Wiki-Style]]` Links](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/autocomplete#syntax-specific-autocomplete-suggestions)
* [Global Auto-Complete Suggestions](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/autocomplete#global-autocomplete-suggestions)
* [Transcription of Audio and Video Files](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/transcription)
* [Extract Text from PDFs](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/document-scanning#extracting-text-from-pdf-files)

I would like to thank everyone who uses Drafts, those that support the app with a Pro subscription, and all the great community members who share their time and creative solutions with others – both on this forum and elsewhere!

I don&#39;t like to be too specific about future plans, but we have a lot of good things coming in 2022...including celebrating the 10th anniversary of Drafts&#39; original 1.0 release (Yikes!).

Here&#39;s hoping 2022 is great for you and yours, and thanks again for using Drafts!</description>

            <p>I’ve been using Drafts since 2012/2013 and I don’t know what I’d do without it.</p>
<p>I’m a happy pro subscriber for years</p>
<p>I know I don’t use nearly half the features. perhaps 2022 I’ll finally figure out more ways to use it.</p>
<p>But that’s one of the best features of Drafts. It’s easily accessible to all levels.</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping the simplicity even as you’ve added features that I can’t even contemplate how I’d use them (like live audio transcription!)</p>
