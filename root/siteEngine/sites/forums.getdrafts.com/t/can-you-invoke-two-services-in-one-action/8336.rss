    <title>Can you invoke two services in one action?</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/can-you-invoke-two-services-in-one-action/8336</link>
    <description>Hi,

What I do a quick capture, I want to upload it into a dropbox folder, and then send a task to todoist that reminds me to check the folder.  I don&#39;t necessarily need to link back to the file in dropbox, but I would like to have a reminder to check.

Can this be done?  I&#39;m a novice to Drafts, but wondering if this has been done before</description>

            <p>Yep. I’ve got actions that invoke mail, save a file to Dropbox, another to OneDrive, and yet another to iCloud.</p>
<p>String as many steps together as you want.</p>
