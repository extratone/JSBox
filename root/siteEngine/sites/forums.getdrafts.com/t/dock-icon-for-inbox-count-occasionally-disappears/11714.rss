    <title>Dock icon for inbox count occasionally disappears</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/dock-icon-for-inbox-count-occasionally-disappears/11714</link>
    <description>Hello,

I’ve enabled badge icon for inbox count on my Mac, but sometimes the badge would disappear. The issue can be temporarily fixed by going to Drafts preferences, disabling and re-enabling &quot;Display inbox count on dock icon&quot;.

I haven’t been able to identify a way to reliably reproduce the issue, but apparently it only happens when Drafts is re-launched after being quit, e.g. after a reboot. 

macOS version: 12.0.1(21A559)
Drafts version: 30.0.1 (24)

Best regards</description>

            <p>I’d estimate it happens around 2–3 times per week. It’s hard to discern any patterns, but I’d definitely post here if I could reliably reproduce.</p>

            <p>Will keep an eye out for this issue. Have not seen it myself or had other reports, does it happen a lot? Definitely let me know if you find a way to reproduce.</p>
