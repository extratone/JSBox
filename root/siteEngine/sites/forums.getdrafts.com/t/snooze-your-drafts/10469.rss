    <description>This setup enables you to **„snooze“ drafts** by sending them to the Reminders app and fetching them back when they are due.

It&#39;s a combination of a drafts action, a shortcut automation and some settings. Here are detailed instructions to set it up:

            <p>a minor shortcoming is that the due date field of the snooze action applies some natural language processing, but is missing some (e.g. “in 3 days” does not work, “next saturday” does, however)</p>

            <p>I feel immediately uneasy thinking about this “future creation date” idea. But I like how in you screenshot in that thread, the workspace is actually called “no future” <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>
<p>Yes, my solution requires an iOS device, forget to mention that. However I think that my solution also has the benefit that you can change the due date of a draft in ever calendar app that syncs with reminders (most do).</p>

            <p>It is <em>technically</em> possible to do this in Drafts using workspace date filtering and  an action to specify a future date for the draft creation property. This does require a Drafts Pro subscription (workspaces are a pro feature), but it will also work on a Mac (macOS not currently being able to run Shortcuts).</p>
<p>The details were covered in this thread.</p>

    I love the email inbox metaphor being used in Drafts! 
I work on longer drafts and I frequently want to put the draft down for a few days without thinking about it before I dive back in for a session. In this case I don’t want the draft to crowd my inbox and I don’t want to have to remember to get back to it at a later date by finding it manually (or setting a reminder elsewhere) 
As a long time user of boomerang and a current user of simplehuman for my email, one of my favorite things is to be …
