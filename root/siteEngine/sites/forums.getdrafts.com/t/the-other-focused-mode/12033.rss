    <title>(The other) Focused mode</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/the-other-focused-mode/12033</link>
    <description>I often like to switch between an uncluttered super clean interface  (just the writing area) and the full interface. The only way I see doing it right now is to press CMD+1, CMD+0, S+CMD+T, OPT+CMD+T  (and whatever shortcut you want to assign to show/hide action bar), and then resizing a bit the window manually.

Honestly I would really love if that was just one click, one shortcut.

I ended up using Keyboard Maestro for that, but wouldn&#39;t it be nice if it was built in?

            <p>I think, as of the latest version, the configure window action step should do what you want.</p>

            <p>Two hide items are missing, tag bar and action bar, so likely not going to write it as an action. But thank you for the idea.</p>

            <p>Wouldn’t know where to start, I took a look at the draft script reference but couldn’t find anything related to the user interface. Ideas?</p>

            <p>Could you not script all those show/hide options in a Drafts action and assign a keyboard shortcut to it?</p>
<p>That would have the advantage of people being able to tweak and tailor it too.</p>
