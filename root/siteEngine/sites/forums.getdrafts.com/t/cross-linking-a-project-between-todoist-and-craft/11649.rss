    <title>Cross linking a project between todoist and craft</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/cross-linking-a-project-between-todoist-and-craft/11649</link>
    <description>this action is only useful for Todoist and Craft users. It could maybe be adapted for other Task managers or note apps (totally possible with Drafts itself) but I haven&#39;t looked into this deeper.

I developed an action which is really useful when you often create project documents in Craft and would like to link them to a corresponding project in todoist

It prompts you for a title of the project and then creates the new project in todoist and a new document in Craft (based on a template) which are linked to each other.

The Drafts action can be downloaded here: https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1sk</description>
