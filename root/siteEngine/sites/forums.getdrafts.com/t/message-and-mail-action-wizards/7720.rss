    <title>Message and Mail Action Wizards</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/message-and-mail-action-wizards/7720</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve released a couple of [web-based action builders](https://tools.getdrafts.com/wizards/) as an experiment in trying to make it easier for new users to get started with creating custom actions for a couple of common use-cases.

Initially, there are two wizards, one for creating Message actions, and one for creating Mail actions, with minimal configuration.

[**Try the Action Wizards ↗**](https://tools.getdrafts.com/wizards/)

I&#39;m interested in feedback on use of these wizards, if they are worth expanding on, etc.

These are completely client-side web tools, which work by constructing install URLs for actions dynamically based on content in a web form.

#### Example:

            <p>Nice!</p>
<p>Would be nice if you can select your mail cliënt. I use Airmail instead of Apple Mail, so the Mail action Wizard doesn’t work for me.</p>
<p>But basically is this what I would love 2 see.</p>

            <p>These are very helpful. I have an action for mailing to a group but this exposes more possibilities such as additional template tags. I’m less keen on learning a scripting language so the forms allow me to focus on using Drafts vs building functionality to use Drafts. Much appreciated and look forward to more <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Thanks.</p>

            <p>i just installed them and they work handily -</p>
<p>I really started getting my head around actions 6 months ago - and use it a lot to create and then publish to files - for later publishing into a blot site and also to publish into my micro blog site</p>
<p>i have seen other actions in the collection for mail and messages - but yours I like more - because they allow a series of these to be preset to different groups and people</p>
<p>I can think of another use case around What’s App - so many groups and spaces in there - this would be perfect … I tend not to be a big publisher into Whats App - so wouldn’t use it, but am sure if these two new actions are picked up - whats app would be … it might need to be phone only ? although the mac has an app called chat mate for whats app</p>
<p>Bottom line - thankyou</p>
<p>To me as a technical doofus - I find actions really good - and always try out what I see - e.g. Brett T published a whole series of Markdown actions recently - I tried - and then deleted - they are too edge casey for my use - but if you are trying to explore how to simply use actions to draw people in - this is perfect.</p>
<p>side note - I have now worked out how to move actions around - put them in different groups etc … maybe there is a second thread that explores better help to bring people into the world - extra ordinarily powerful - but not immediately apparent.</p>
<p>A LATER PS - having the email action support using HTML mail would be great - I tried editing the message to do that and got a not supported warning … doable?</p>
