    <title>Custom markdown tags with Preview</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/custom-markdown-tags-with-preview/11474</link>
    <description>I have made a series of actions that allow me to add custom tags and to preview them with a custom css class.

I have this currently working only for my workflow, but since is something hard to find, let me know if more of you are interested in something like this, so I can modify my version to be more widely apealing

## Example

In the following line, the custom tag is `¨m  ¨` and has the class name “**motion**”, and with the styles it sets the text to **bold** and _italic_
```
¨m Any Text ¨
``` 

So the complete text beeing like
- - -
\# Title

This is a line ¨m with a custom tag ¨

\- This is a list item

- - -

While end up looking like this

- - -
# Title

This is a line **_with a custom tag_**

- This is a list item
- - -

The tags could be set to anything if you know how to find it in Regex, or with a simple in and out descriptor.</description>
