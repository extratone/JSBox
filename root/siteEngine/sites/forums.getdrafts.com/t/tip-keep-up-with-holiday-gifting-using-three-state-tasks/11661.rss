    <title>TIP: Keep Up with Holiday Gifting using Three-State Tasks</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-keep-up-with-holiday-gifting-using-three-state-tasks/11661</link>
    <description>When it&#39;s holiday season, I&#39;m often trying to keep up with gift ideas for my friends and family, but in the days of online ordering, I&#39;ve found it&#39;s hard to know what state a gift idea is in...is it just an idea? Did I order it online? ...or I have actually received the item.

With three-state tasks, it&#39;s easy to keep up with each of those state. When I have an idea, I add it a list in a draft as an incomplete tasks (`{ }`). When I&#39;m done researching/shopping it and order it, I tap that item to put it in an in-progress state (`{-}`), and when I&#39;ve received the order and hidden it away in the closet, I mark it done (`{x}`).

Custom syntaxes and task definitions in Drafts make this a lot easier.

### Background

In the default Markdown syntaxes that ship with Drafts, you can create [tappable tasks](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/tasks) by typing `[ ]` in your text. This is great for simple on-off checkboxes, but sometimes you have more than two states to track.

Custom syntaxes in Drafts can define additional types of tasks. The [SimpleList+ syntax](https://directory.getdrafts.com/s/1jG) is a great example. It supports square bracket on-off tasks (`[ ]`) like the Markdown syntaxes, but also includes support for three-state tasks using curly braces (`{ }`). If you type `{ }` (open-close curly braces with a space between), at the beginning of a list lin, you create such a task...tapping it will rotate the task between `{ }`, `{-}`, and `{x}`. In the done state, it will even apply strike-through formatting to the line.

### Setup

To try out this system:

* Install the [SimpleList+](https://directory.getdrafts.com/s/1jG) custom syntax from the Directory (follow link, tap the &quot;install&quot; button).
* Open Drafts, create a new draft and assign it the new &quot;SimpleList+&quot; syntax you just installed. You can do this in the `Aa` settings on iOS, or the syntax dropdown below the editor on Mac.
* Start a Markdown-style list, by typing `- { }` at the beginning of a line and then some text.

That&#39;s it! The `{ }` will become tappable, and you can toggle its state as you order and receive items.</description>

<p>Pardon me for being <em>daft</em> when it comes to my drafts (heee sorry), but is there an action/button somewhere for this magical tri-state task? I looked thru the directory extensively, or so I thought….</p>

            <p>Try <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1tC">this example action</a>. It works like the default “Toggle Tasks” action, but for <code>{ }</code> style tasks.</p>
