- [**App Store**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1016366447?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;at=11l4Cf&amp;ct=website)
- **URL Scheme**: bear://
- [**URL Scheme Documentation**](http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/X-callback-url%20Scheme%20documentation/)

The note taking app Bear supports integration via it&#39;s Share extension, and URL schemes.  For basic needs, use the Drafts [Share](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1BF) action and select Bear in the iOS share sheet. Bear&#39;s share extension supports capturing new notes, or append-prepending to existing notes you select in the share extension.

### URL Actions

Bear has extensive x-callback-url support, allowing creation of new notes, as well as appending/prepending text, navigating to and searching notes. More details can be found in [the Bear URL scheme documentation](http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/X-callback-url%20Scheme%20documentation/).  A few ready-to-use example actions:

- [Send to Bear](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CZ): Send current draft to Bear as a new note, using the first line as the note title, and remaining text as the content of the note - returns to Drafts after completion.
- [Append to Bear Journal](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Em): Append draft to rolling series of monthly Journal notes.

### Cross-Linking

Drafts&#39; [cross-linking syntax](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/drafts/cross-linking#wiki-style-external-links) supports linking directly to notes in Bear using their title, in the format `[[bear:Title of Note]]`. Using this syntax you can create tappable links which open Bear directly to a specific note.

### Scripting

Although URL schemes are the only method to integrate with Bear, they can be powerful. @olivierg has shared a [BearAPI](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Eo) that makes using the more advanced features available with Bear&#39;s URL schemes easy in Drafts action scripts. Advanced users might want to take a look at it.</description>
