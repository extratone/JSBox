    <title>Make Title Current Appointment</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/make-title-current-appointment/9946</link>
    <description>With massive help from @sylumer, I created an action to get your most recent or current calendar event and add to the title of your current draft. This is to aid in referencing your drafts later when you are taking notes in a meeting. 

I created this after searching the Drafts directory and coming up short. I&#39;m honestly surprised no one has thought of this one before, as it seems like such a common use case. 

A couple of things I&#39;m hoping to add:

- A better title (this one&#39;s a mouthful, but at least it&#39;s accurate?) 
- Add attendees 

Anyway, here it is. Happy for feedback!

            <p>I expanded your script a little bit to be able to select the event of several ones are found.<br>
I also changed the behavior to get events from all your calendars, not just the default one.<br>
If somebody finds it useful here is the adapted script. I did not make an action out of it, since I maybe add some meeting template function into it - but I have a running solution at the moment so don’t expect something in the near future <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">// Initialise

let allCalendars = Calendar.getAllCalendars()
const timeWindowMinutes = 180

let foundAppointments = [];
let eventsCount = 0

// Grab events from last 3 hours (based on current time) and append them to an array
for(cal of allCalendars){
let aev = cal.events(Date.today().addMinutes(-timeWindowMinutes), Date.now());
aev.map(ev =&gt; foundAppointments.push(ev.title));
}
for (const foundAppointment of foundAppointments){
	eventsCount = eventsCount +1;
}

// Get the latest event found and add to drafts with a markdown title
if(foundAppointments.length &gt; 1)
{
	// select event
	let p = new Prompt()
	p.title = "Select Event"
	for(appntmnt of foundAppointments){
		p.addButton(appntmnt)
	}
	if(p.show()){
	
	draft.prepend ("# " + p.buttonPressed + "\n");
	draft.update();
	
	} else {
	
	 app.displayWarningMessage("No event selected");
	
	}
} else if (foundAppointments.length == 1){

	draft.prepend ("# " + foundAppointments [eventsCount-1] + "\n");
	draft.update();

} else {
	app.displayWarningMessage("No events found");
}

    I leverage the Event object to create drafts for upcoming meetings. It would be very helpful to be able to retrieve the event organizer and attendees properties as well. That would save me a lot of typing when the meeting starts.

    <a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/evantravers">@evantravers</a> - This is awesome.  Is there a way I can figure out the data elements of the ‘event’? For example in addition to the ‘startDate’, ‘notes’ etc, it would be really useful to pull the attendee’s or those invited to the meeting. 
TIA 
Mike

    We use Office 365 at work, and I’ve been down this road. 
tl;dr - There’s not a whole lot you can do at this point. 
Things that you can do: 

Create an email in Drafts, send to the Outlook iOS app (although you will need to add recipients there)
Take the content of a draft, copy to the clipboard, open OneNote, paste into new note or use the share sheet to send data from a draft directly to the app
Create, update, save text notes in OneDrive

The other more interesting things? Like pushing info …

            <p>Yeah, I did notice that in the documentation after posting this. I thought there might be a hidden function in there regardless, but none of the obvious ones seemed to work.</p>
<p>Maybe <a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/agiletortoise">@agiletortoise</a> can implement the world’s most niche feature request to enable this.</p>

            <p>There isn’t currently an option to get attendee information from events in Drafts. You would have to rely on an external option for now (perhaps varying by platform) to get such information.</p>
