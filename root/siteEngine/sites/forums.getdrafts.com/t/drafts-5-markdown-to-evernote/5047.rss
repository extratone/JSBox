    <title>Drafts 5 Markdown to Evernote</title>

    <description>Hi there,

I need some help. I am not a programer and I do not understand much of the programing language that happens in these posts, so please be patient with me. 

I love Drafts and I use it as my primary information inbox for anything I need to do, save, remember, text, or email. I want to take notes in drafts, and I love Markdown, but I cannot get them to format correctly when I transfer to Evernote. 

Can someone please assist, and walk me through how to make this happen. I am sure there is a solution. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.</description>

            <p>I would think that just changing “[[time]]” to “[[title]]” and “[[draft]]” to “[[body]]” ought to do the trick.</p>

            <p>Thank you, that works the way I would like except:</p>
<p>Is there anyway to make the top line of the draft the title of the note in Evernote?</p>

            <p>Start with this standard action from the action directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1E9" rel="nofollow noopener">Save to Evernote</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then let us know exactly what, if anything, you are having issues with.</p>
<p>Note that not all syntax is supported by Evernote. You can find a few discussions about that on this forum.</p>
