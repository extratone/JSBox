    <title>IFTTT Support Again?</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/ifttt-support-again/9449</link>
    <description>I noticed in an old post that their used to be support for IFTTT integration. What happened to it? I have an IFTTT pro account, but a Zapier pro account is far too expensive for me &amp; I’m already at my limit for the free version. Will there ever be IFTTT support again?</description>

            <p>I <em>think</em> IFTTT has similar integration points to Zapier. You can create webhooks that you post to, so the setup is similar to the <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-zapier-with-drafts/608">Zapier integration</a> we’ve documented.</p>
<p>I believe their iOS app has Shortcuts integration as well, so it may be as simple as building the Shortcut you want to trigger IFTTT events, and triggering those from Drafts.</p>

            <p>It was a comment by the creator of Drafts on a forum or blog post. I’m sorry, I’m having trouble finding it again. I had no particular thoughts at the moment of what it would do with Drafts, but the ability to both use Drafts as a trigger and create new Drafts would be cool. I actually had the thought more of using Drafts as a trigger to be able to send a draft to even more places.</p>

            <p>If it were the creation of a draft (for example) I’d consider Pushcut and a shortcut - if iOS were an acceptable platform.</p>
<p>(In fact that’s what I do with my Daily Draft each morning.)</p>

            <p>What is it that you want to do with IFTTT? I’m assuming it is more likely to be create new drafts than retrieve information or use it as a trigger. If so you can go via Apple Reminders as Drafts supports import from that.</p>
<p>Which previous post are you referring to? Can you provide a link for context?</p>
