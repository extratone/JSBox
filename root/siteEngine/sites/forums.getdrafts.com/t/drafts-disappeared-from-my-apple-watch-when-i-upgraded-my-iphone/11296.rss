    <title>Drafts disappeared from my Apple Watch when I upgraded my iPhone</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-disappeared-from-my-apple-watch-when-i-upgraded-my-iphone/11296</link>
    <description>I am a Drafts Pro user. I&#39;m successfully running ver. 28.1 (32) on my new iPhone 13 Mini.

When I upgraded from my previous iPhone SE, Drafts disappeared from my Apple Watch (series 2, WatchOS 6.3), and I can&#39;t get it back.

In the Watch app on iOS, Drafts does not show up in either the Installed list or the Available Apps list.

I&#39;ve tried rebooting both devices, and deleting/reinstalling Drafts on iOS, to no avail.

Any ideas on how to get Drafts back on my Watch?</description>

            <p>This reminds me - in the “excuses to upgrade” category <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=10" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> - is there anything to look forward to in Drafts with Watch 7? (I have a larger size Watch 5 and would obviously upgrade to same for Watch 7.)</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, we had to leave behind the Series 0, 1, and 2 watches in this upgrade cycle. The Apple Watch app was re-written using the newer Apple interface technologies (SwiftUI) and for compatibility we had to require watchOS 7 or greater - which cannot run on those models.</p>
<p>I don’t love Apple’s solution here, but when an watch app is not compatible with your watch, it just hides the app as if it does not exist - no warnings/messages, etc.</p>
