    <description>[Twitter Splitter](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Fb).

This action is intended to let you split a longer text into Tweet sized chunks. On running it you get a choice of three options:

* Add Index
* No Index
* No space for index

The first two options cut your text at 274 characters, this would be enough to add ` 99/99` to the end of each tweet, which should be enough.

Adding an index adds `1/5` (for example) to the end of each tweet, which can be very useful.

The last option cuts your text at 280 characters at the longest.

Each tweet will likely be slightly shorter than the maximum, as the last whole word before the character limit is where it gets cut. Sections are separated with `===`, to allow for easy copy and pasting or parsing.</description>
