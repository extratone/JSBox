    <title>Let the list of documents stay open?</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/let-the-list-of-documents-stay-open/7482</link>
    <description>Was´nt there a way to let the menu bar on the left, with the list of documents like the Inbox always stay open?

I am trying to visit and check lots of documents, but each time, the list of documents vanishes and only the selected text is visible, wholescreen.
This does not realy work for me.

I was sure that i had this different before, so that the selected text just opens to the right, while the list of files is still visible.

Did i do something wrong?
Was this changed?
Can i configured this somehow?

If not, could you PLEASE add such an option?</description>

Thanks.</p>
<p>I never touched this knowingly and could just barely remember that i already saw this in a different configuration.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
