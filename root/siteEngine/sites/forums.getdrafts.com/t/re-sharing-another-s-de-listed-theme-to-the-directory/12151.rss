    <title>Re-sharing another’s de-listed theme to the Directory?</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/re-sharing-another-s-de-listed-theme-to-the-directory/12151</link>
    <description>I’ve found myself in possession of a drafts theme entitled “Black &amp; Yellow” which has apparently become homeless.

![Black &amp; Yellow Theme](upload://ezaWDFokQ7EoshZu74YpNCWdUOw.png)

It’s actually been one of my favorite dark themes in the past few months. I’m just wondering: was this a default theme? Would anyone like to claim it? And if not... would it be inappropriate for me to put it back on the Directory with this explanation?</description>

            <p>Not sure what the original source was…themes can be installed from the directory, which should maintain a link, but can be installed from files or other sources which were never in the directory.</p>
<p>I think you are fine to share it again. It is definitely <em>not</em> a default theme.</p>
