    <title>Twitter: multiple accounts, multiple actions, big problem</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/twitter-multiple-accounts-multiple-actions-big-problem/3743</link>
    <description>Hi, new member and new Drafts user. Just had my &#39;lightbulb moment&#39; 48 hours ago so be kind. :grinning:

I&#39;m trying to set up Drafts to handle multiple Twitter accounts. So far I have been able to successfully set up two by duplicating the Tweet Action and adding a different account name to the Credential Identifier.

However, when I tried to set up a third Action, using the above procedure, I got as far as attempting to send a tweet when I hit a problem. When the Auhorization Needed screen came up it directed me to my second, already set up, account instead of allowing me to authorise a new account.

Can any patient, experienced Drafts user explain to me where I am going wrong? Am I limited to two Twitter accounts only? It would be a shame if this were so as this would severely limit one of my planned uses of Drafts.

Thanks for your time and attention.</description>

            <p>You can have as many as you want. I think the problem you are running into is that OAuth authentication redirects you to the Twitter website in Safari and Safari is remembering your login from the other account.</p>
<p>To link another account, you’ll need to sign out of the first one in Safari. I believe you can do this from the authentication page - there’s some “sign out” or “use different account” type link.  If that’s not clear, you can go to <a href="http://twitter.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://twitter.com</a> in Safari first, log out, then go back to Drafts and trigger the authentication process again.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>
