    <title>Drafts 19.2 (iOS) Released</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-19-2-ios-released/7236</link>
    <description>Drafts 19.2 (iOS) has been released [in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1236254471?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;at=11l4Cf&amp;ct=site), details below.

(see also [19.2 macOS Release Notes](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-19-2-macos-released/7241))

- **New:** Editor settings have new tab key options, allowing you to select whether the tab key inserts a tab, two spaces or four spaces.
- **New:** Workspaces can be shared via directory.
- **Fix:** Trackpad/Magic Mouse swiping can be used like touch swiping to open drafts/actions lists.
- **Fix:** Syntaxes (like TaskPaper) which apply strikethough styles, the style might not get cleared if edits (like removing @done from a task) no longer required it.
- **Fix:** Problems reordering actions in the action list in groups with hidden actions.
- **Fix:** Editor margins not updating after pinned side panels hidden/shown on iPad
- **Fix:** Issue with editor not reflecting changes to a draft made in a scripted action if the draft was loaded in the script via `Draft.find` instead of referenced as the global `draft` variable.
- **Fix:** Hopefully a fix for an issue causing the app to not launch properly on iOS 13.4 for a few users.
