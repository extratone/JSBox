            <p>Good to know - Iâ€™d noticed that with WhatsApp and was wondering if Apple had excluded them on purpose. Hony soit qui mal y pense <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>This is an iOS 14 bug. Can happen with any app with share extensions after an update. Reboot seems the only way to fix at the moment. Hopefully Apple will resolve soon.</p>

            <p>This problem was on two different model but iOS up-to-date iPads.</p>
<p>It was resolved when I rebooted.</p>
<p>Previous auto-updates of Drafts 5 have not had this glitch before.</p>
<p>All seems well now.</p>
