    <description>Just published version 2.0 of my Things Parser. 

Action Directory link: http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1DV

More info below:

# Things Parser

## Intro

This script action sends each line of the draft to Things 3. Special characters can be added to each line (after the task name) to create additional metadata about the task.

The syntax is as follows:

* \#Project Name 
* @Tag Name
* ==Heading
* //Task note
* !Natural Language Deadline String
* \*Checklist Item

Each of these markup characters should be immediately preceded by a space. The task name must come first in the line. The date and time of the event can be written in natural language anywhere in the line, and does not require a special character. The script also automatically detects whether or not a time has been written. If a date and time are written, it adds a task with that date and a reminder at that time. If only a date is written, it doesn’t add a reminder.

Multiple tags and checklist items can be entered.

Special characters can be used elsewhere in the line, as long as they are not immediately preceded by a space, so for example the following is fine.

//Note containing email address: me@domain.com 

is perfectly fine.

Examples:

	Task name
*Adds item to Inbox*

	Task name on Wednesday
*Adds item to Upcoming with Wednesday as date*

	Task name on Wednesday at 6pm
*Adds item to Upcoming with Wednesday as date and a reminder at 6pm*

	Task name on Wednesday at 6pm !Friday
*Same as above with a deadline of Friday*

	Task name on Wednesday at 6pm #Project Name ==Heading @Tag 1 @Tag 2 ++Additional Note !Friday *first thing *second thing *third thing

*Adds item to project called `Project Name` under `Heading` with date of Wednesday, reminder at 6pm, two tags `Tag 1` and `Tag 2`, an additional note `Additional Note`, and a checklist with the following three items:*

* `first thing`
* `second thing`
* `third thing`

## Block-Based Entry

To save time in entering metadata, if the first line of a block of text contains only metadata, this will be inherited by every other line in that block. So instead of writing:

	task 1 today
	task 2 today
	task 3 today

you can simply write:

	Today
	task 1
	task 2
	task 3

This works with all possible metadata:

	today at 5pm !Friday #Project ==Heading @Tag 1 @Tag 2 *checklist item 1 *checklist item 2 //note
	task 1
	task 2
	task 3

If a task has metadata that conflicts with the block heading, the task’s metadata wins, but it will still inherit anything that doesn’t conflict. So things like this are fine:

	#Project !Friday
	Task 1
	Task 2 !Monday
	Task 3

Task 2 will be added to `Project` but will have a different deadline to the other tasks. 

Multiple blocks can be entered within a single draft and should be separated by a blank line.

## New Project Creation

Using the syntax `+Project` you can create a new project and add tasks to it. It works in two different modes: in-line and block-based. 

### In-Line

With the in-line mode you can just add `+Project` to the end of any line and it will create a new project with that task as the only entry. Headings can also be created, and an area can be specified. Any other metadata is assigned to the task:

	task +Project ==Heading #Area today at 5pm !Friday

This creates a project called `Project` in `Area` with a heading and a single task under that heading. The task is assigned to today, has a reminder for 5pm, and has a deadline of Friday.

### Block-Based

Block-based mode works in similar way with a couple of small changes: all metadata on the block heading is inherited by the new project, not the tasks, and multiple headings can be specified. Metadata must be specified for each task individually. If a task is given one of the headings specified in the block heading, it will be put under that heading, otherwise it will be assigned to the project with no heading.

	+Project today at 5pm ==Heading 1 ==Heading 2 #Area @tag
	Task with no heading
	Task under heading 1 ==Heading 1
	Task under heading 2 ==Heading 2

In this case, the date and tag will be added to the project, *not* the tasks.

It is possible to combine the project creation feature with the block-based task metadata inheritance using two blocks, one which creates the new project, and then another which adds tasks under it. So for example, if I wanted to create an important work project due on Friday with three tasks I wanted to work on today, I could do the following:

	+Project #Work !Friday @Important
	
	today #Project
	task 1
	task 2
	task 3</description>

            <p>For all the fans of Things Parser, a big update has just come to Things Parser in <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1DV" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">version 3</a>. I’ve decided to move from the old custom syntax to TaskPaper to take advantage of the syntax highlighting in Drafts and to aid compatibility with other apps. It also adds variables, including date variables with time offsets. You can read more about the details in <a href="https://polymaths.blog/2020/12/things-parser-3-for-drafts" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">my blog post</a>.</p>
<p>For die-hard fans of version 2, this will remain available <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1fU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">on the action directory</a> but will no longer be maintained.</p>

            <p>Syntax question re: <code>#Project</code> vs. <code>#Area</code>:</p>
<p>I think I’m being dense because no one else has mentioned this, but don’t your <code>#Project Name</code> and <code>#Area</code> syntaxes conflict? I’ve read the documentation a couple times and only see examples of <code>#Area</code> in the context of creating new projects with <code>+Project</code>. I’ve never seen an example combining <code>#area</code> with <code>#project</code>.</p>
<p>Definitely wouldn’t rule out user error. Here’s what I’m trying to parse for a test run:</p>
<pre><code>+Learn to Use Things Parser for Drafts #Home ==Research ==Implementation ==Evaluation

<p>Feature request: Some kind of comment syntax that would stop the parser from evaluating a given line.</p>
<p>Also, I think this is a bug. I’m typing this on Thursday 4/30. When I feed the parser this line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>testing !Sunday</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it creates a to-do with a deadline on Sunday 5/10—not this coming Sunday, but a week from Sunday, 10 days away.</p>

            <p>So, firstly I just wanted to say I think this is great.</p>
<p>So far a great use I have found for it is problematic for me since I have a document with a number of suggestions about local networking meetups etc. It contains places and times etc.</p>
<p>What I am hoping to do is to schedule some actions according to the document by breaking it down using the delimiters that you have set up so that I can send the whole text into ‘Things’ and have your action do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>So am I right in suggesting that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Everything for 1 task has to be in the same sentence. i.e. Your action differentiates a new line as a new task?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One problem I have run up against is that if I am not mistaken I can’t refer to any Date or Time in the notes as they appear to be removed when I sent them over.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am assuming the following presents all kinds of problems as it’s not working as I would like.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Networking</span> ==Networking Events Dalycom Nottingham Business Networking  //Thursdays 8.00am - 10.00am Contact Anita Popat, 01509 410 407 *Ugly Bread Bakery, 21 Market Street  Nottingham NG1 6HX</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Networking</span> ==Networking Events An informal business networking event for Businesses in Nottingham and the surrounding areas //taking place on the 3rd Thursday of every month (starting 18th January 2018) from 8.00am - 10.00am.</p>
<p>If this were possible, I’d like to see it under Networking (which is one of my Projects) as listed items, and I’d continue to work down the sheet to highlight the others.</p>
<p>So far when I send this over, I get nothing at all anywhere?! <img src="https://forums.getdrafts.com/images/emoji/apple/worried.png?v=6" title=":worried:" class="emoji" alt=":worried:"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/u/pdavisonreiber">@pdavisonreiber</a> Can you explain why?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This is designed to work when adding tasks to an existing project, but not when creating a new project. So for an existing project</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#Existing Project ==Existing Heading
Task 1
Task 2
Task 3
</code></pre>
<p>will add three tasks under the heading. If you wanted to do this with a new project, you would have to create it first and then add the tasks in two separate blocks, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">+New Project ==New Heading 1 ==New Heading 2

#New Project ==New Heading 1
Task 1
Task 2
Task 3
</code></pre>
<p>The reason for this design is that you can only add headings to a project <em>on creation</em>, so users will have to indicate all the headings they want after the <code>+New Project</code>. Tasks in the same block can’t be added to <em>all</em> of those headings, so if the user’s intention is to add some of them to particular headings, that needs to be specified.</p>

            <p>No, that’s not possible unfortunately. The script would need to know the ID of the project after it had been created in order to update it, which Things doesn’t allow. The user can manually get this ID from the Things app, but as far as I know you can’t do this programmatically.</p>

            <p>Is it not possible to add more headers to a project once it’s created?</p>
<p>If I run this:<br>
+test ==header</p>
<p>It works as expected. If I then run this;</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#test</span> ==header 2</p>
<p>I get nothing. I tried it with spaces after the ==header and without. With follow up tasks and without. Can’t seem to get it working.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

            <p>Is there a way to block enter items under a heading? I tried and it didn’t seem to work, I have to add ==heading after each task.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Yes, I think that’s it. The parser first looks for any dates in the string, and it is picking up your heading as a date. I need to adjust it to ignore dates that have delimiters immediately preceding them. It does currently do that with deadlines, but not the other kinds of fields. I’ll see if I can get that fixed sometime soon.</p>

            <p>Just tried this again with a different heading name “Current Focus” and the parser worked as expected.  So it doesn’t seem having a space in the header name is the issue.  I wonder if its because there is a time based word in the other header I was using (i.e. This week)?</p>

            <p>Hi again.  I just tried this again without the spaces before the delimiters.  using “This week” for the heading is still causing issues.  When I change it to “This_week” the issue is resolved. Does the parser stop at the end of a word?  Any options here, such as requiring parser to look for the heading title in quotes?</p>

            <p>Yes that is the default behaviour. You have to specifically use the symbol + to create new projects. See <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1DV" rel="nofollow noopener">http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1DV</a> for complete documentation.</p>

            <p>This is brilliant and I can’t wait to dive in.  Quick question - is there any way to have it had something to an existing project rather than creating a new one?  Many thanks!!!</p>
