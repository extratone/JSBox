    <description>The groups that won’t appear when trying to add to grid widget appear to be groups created by me and 3rd party creators. The only groups that will appear are the ones that come preinstalled within the app. This suddenly started to happen today after attempting restart due to the Share As Text File action suddenly not working(a separate issue)</description>

            <p>Thanks, the search does show it. But it’s odd because the additional action groups were showing in the list until now</p>

            <p>Did you try searching for the action you are trying to add? The initial display before searching only includes the first few groups in your list for performance reasons, not every action group in your installation.</p>
<p>You should be able to search for additional actions by name in the selection list.</p>
