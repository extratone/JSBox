    <title>Sepia Template - Heads Up</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/sepia-template-heads-up/10203</link>
    <description>I have been using Sepia as a foundation for a new theme - and in my new theme I was modifying the appearance of a quote 

eg;

&gt; &quot;this is a quote&quot;

I was getting a message &#39;Missing Scope&#39; - text.quotation&#39;

Firstly - once you have brought the theme into the new theme editor - when you export you lose the ability to see the layout of the file - it now runs as one big giant text stream - because of this - I couldn&#39;t add the missing scope myself - novice ... I am sure someone who knows the syntax properly could do this ... not me.

So I went back to the default Sepia and decided to build again - assuming somewhere along the line I must have deleted that particular scope. 

But even in the default sepia scope the same issue - &#39;missing scope - text.quotation&#39;

            <p>You cannot fix it for the built-in theme. It’s not a significant issue in this case, and has been fixed in the current beta cycle, just not out in a release. You can use the theme, it won’t cause any problems.</p>

            <p>Pardon to resurrect this old thread, but in my editor preferences I see this alert in the Sepia theme:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Default scope missing. Theme may not fully render some syntaxes.
Missing scope: "text.quotation"
</code></pre>
<p>.</p>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>

            <p>You are right, the <code>text.quotation</code> scope is missing that from that theme and should be there…will fix.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Regarding the “big giant text stream,” if you open the exported JSON file into a code editor like TextMate and use the JSON formatting command (in the TextMate JSON Bundle), that should neaten the formatting for you. Any JSON parser (or web-based JSON parser) should have this ability.</p>
<p>In terms of the scope issue, if it’s permissible for you to post the JSON code or a link to the file, that might help diagnose the issue. I’ll try to take a look at the root Sepia file in the meantime when I have a chance.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
