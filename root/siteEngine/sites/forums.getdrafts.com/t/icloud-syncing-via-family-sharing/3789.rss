    <title>iCloud Syncing via Family sharing</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/icloud-syncing-via-family-sharing/3789</link>
    <description>Hi everyone!
If possible, I need some help with the following:
I have 2 iPhones - one personal and one from work. Obviously they have 2 different Apple IDs and 2 iCloud accounts.
I solved the problem of sharing the same purchased apps by inviting my second account as a family member to the first one. 
So as a result I have the following configuration:

iPhone 1
- Account 1
iPhone 2 
- Account 2
- Account 1 (invited as a family member)

So I have Drafts 5 on both devices - with active subscription (same).

I want the information to be shared across these 2 accounts, but by default it does not work,
Any ideas how I can exchange Drafts between devices?
There is an Export or Backup function, but they also go only to only one iCloud, and I could not fine Import or restore back anyways.
Any help or ideas will be appreciated.
Thank you!</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There is no synching available across different Apple IDs.</p>
<p>You can export/import. You can export all your content <a href="https://getdrafts.com/settings/backups" rel="nofollow noopener">using backups</a>, or by using <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-batch-operations-with-select-operations/898">batch operations</a> to export select drafts.</p>
<p>The export files can be imported by just opening the exported file in Drafts from the Files app, or by using “Import File” in the <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-tap-and-hold-for-new-draft-options/47">new draft options available when you tap and hold “+”</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
