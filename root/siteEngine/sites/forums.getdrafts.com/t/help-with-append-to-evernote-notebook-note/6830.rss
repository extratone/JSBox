    <title>Help with Append to Evernote Notebook &amp; note</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/help-with-append-to-evernote-notebook-note/6830</link>
    <description>My attempt to create an Evernote action to append a draft to an existing notebook called @SHARDS with an existing note called &quot;My current shards&quot; is greyed out on Mac and creates the error
&quot;Has steps not supported on this platform&quot;

And it red-flags a random error on iOS.

https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/15I

It was created as an Evernote action
Note = [[My current shards]]
Notebook = [[@SHARDS]]
Tags = #shard

I&#39;m new to creating my own Drafts Actions (I have watched some of Karl Pulleins&#39;s excellent videos though – perhaps not attentively enough). Where am I going wrong?</description>

            <p>That’s helpful, thank you.  I guess we just have to wait for Evernote to get their act together. Another few years…?</p>

<li>
<p>Evernote action steps do not run on Mac. Due to reasons from the Evernote end. There are notes about compatibility in the <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-evernote-with-drafts/21">Evernote integration guide</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>[[ ]]</code> bracket syntax is for use to insert specific dynamic values using the Drafts template engine, not something you need to wrap static text with. So to write to the notebooks “<span class="mention">@SHARDS</span>”, you just put “<span class="mention">@SHARDS</span>”, not “[[<span class="mention">@SHARDS</span>]]”. <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-drafts-templates/3728">This article</a> is a good place to get the basics of templates and tags.</p>
