Expect those features, new service integrations, as well as a new focus on building resources to help you get the most out of Drafts! Stay tuned.

## Drafts Pro Changes

The price of Drafts Pro will be changing on Jan. 1, 2021. We have [posted more details about this change](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-pro-price-change-coming-jan-1-2021/9271), but be aware that if you have an existing subscription, or start one before Jan. 1, 2021, the price change will not affect you. 

## Thank You!

A big thanks to all the people who use Drafts. I&#39;m always amazed by the consistently positive, productive people who engage with Drafts, use it in their workflows, and share what they&#39;ve done with the community. It&#39;s a big part of what makes Drafts great, and I genuinely appreciate the support!</description>

            <p>Thanks, Greg, for all you’ve done to evolve Drafts in 2020. I’m a very happy user.</p>
<p>I hope in 2021 you find some time to make the Action Development  task easier and slicker. I’m thinking particularly of the case where an Action has a single Javascript step.</p>
