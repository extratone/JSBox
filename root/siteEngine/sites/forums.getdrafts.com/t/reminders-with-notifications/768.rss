    <description>Hi guys, 

I was wondering if there was a way to add reminders with notifications on a specific time to Reminders.app via Drafts 5? Haven&#39;t come across any action. 

Thanks

            <p>It is possible with scripting by adding alarms to the the reminder. It is not possible with plain Reminders steps.  I also have not seen examples posted in the directory as of yet.  Also pretty easy to with <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-fantastical-with-drafts/25">Fantastical reminder actions</a>, which can parse out those values from plain text.</p>
