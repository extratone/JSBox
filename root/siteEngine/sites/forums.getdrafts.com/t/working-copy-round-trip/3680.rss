    <title>Working Copy Round Trip</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/working-copy-round-trip/3680</link>
    <description>In [a previous question](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/best-practices-for-working-with-working-copy/3552), I asked about round-tripping files from Working Copy. I ended up communicating with the developer and he created a new url-scheme component that makes it straightforward to import a file and then write it back to Working Copy with a minimum of user input--you only have to select the file/repo/location once as opposed to on both ends. 

You can see the actions I made to reflect this below. Please improve them if you have ideas!

  <blockquote>
    JavaScript formatting in the editor in the script step.
When searching for an action, you can edit the action, but you can’t tell what action group it is in if you say wanted to move it. Having that info in the action would be useful for this sort of thing.
An option to store a small amount of custom meta data against a draft. e.g. in say Microsoft Word you can add a field to store the name of a client or a secrecy classification. I’m thinking this could have many uses, but one I’d really like …
