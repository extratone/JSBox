    <title>I have an action that works fine but it doesn&#39;t run on more than 1 item at a time</title>

    <description>I have an action that works like a charm but it only runs 1 item as a time, is there way that I can select an entire set of items and run the action?

Here&#39;s the action `draft.content = draft.content.replace(/{{c.::(.*?)}}/,&quot;\n\n$1&quot;);
draft.update();`

Thanks for any help guys</description>

Assign, remove, rename tags.
Flag/unflag
Reassign syntaxes
Merge/duplicate

Quick demo videos and instructions for performing batch operations on both iOS and the Mac follow.
