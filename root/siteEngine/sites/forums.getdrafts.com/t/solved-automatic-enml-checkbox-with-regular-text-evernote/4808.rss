    <title>[solved]Automatic enml checkbox with regular text - Evernote</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/solved-automatic-enml-checkbox-with-regular-text-evernote/4808</link>
    <description>Hi all,
Very new to this perfect tool. I really get more productive in all my lost moments, waiting for planes, trains, subways...
I write meeting notes with a Neo smartpen and then send the transcription to drafts.
From there after reviewing it I send it to Evernote.
I’d like to use the markdown trick for checkboxes [ ] and [x] in order to have my notes and the next steps or to-dos. All my todo lists in Evernote are synchronized to Todoist.
I have found a script that transforms checkboxes in enml format but it erases all formatting and keeps only bullet points and tasks.
Do you have any idea how I could optimize it?
Thanks

            <p>Hello jayelevy<br>
That’s the one I used but I have realized now that I need to set different paragraphs between text and billet points to keep it as it is into Draft<br>
Thanks for your help<br>

            <p>Have you tried this action?</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Ea" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Ea</a></p>
<p>This should do what you are seeking. That is, convert markdown formatted to-do’s to Evernote to-do’s while maintaining other markdown formatting.</p>
