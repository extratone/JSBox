    <title>Problem sending drafts to Obsidian with text enclosed with &quot;%%&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/problem-sending-drafts-to-obsidian-with-text-enclosed-with/12243</link>
    <description>I am using a single File action step to send current drafts to my Obsidian vault. I’ve customized the File action template to add both yaml and comments enclosed with “%%” (without the quotes) to the current draft. The template looks like this:

---
aliases: 
---
%%
role:: 
type:: 
%%
# [[title]]
[[body]]  

My problem: the “%%” and “%%” (again, minus the quotes) are converting to “&lt;p&gt;” and “&lt;/p&gt;” after sending the draft to Obsidian. Does anyone know how to keep the double-parentheses in the template from converting?</description>

            <p>Double-percent is the Drafts’ template engine’s markup for running text through the Markdown parser (<a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates#other-special-markup">docs</a>). If you want to use them without them passing through Markdown conversion, escape them with a backslash, like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">\%%
role::
type::
%%
</code></pre>
