    <title>Unable to send to Evernote from desktop app</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/unable-to-send-to-evernote-from-desktop-app/12252</link>
    <description>I have three Evernote actions that work on my iPad and iPhone, but NOT on the desktop app:

1. Save to Evernote
2. Append to Evernote Journal
3. Save to Evernote (Full formatting)

The message I get when attempting to execute the action on my MacBook is &quot;This action has steps which are not supported on this platform&quot;.

What gives?

p.s. - I did try searching for other posts that discuss this issue before creating a new one. Hopefully, I didn&#39;t create a duplicate post.</description>

            <p>Evernote’s integration story is a bit of a mess. They never supported Mac properly, and dropped most of the standard methods of integration (like URLs on iOS and AppleScript on Mac) they did support.</p>
<p>Details in the <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-evernote-with-drafts/21">Evenote integration guide</a> about what you can and can’t do.</p>
<p>I really would only recommend email into Evernote (which you can do with background email actions in Drafts) as a way to integrate right now. The actions that work on iOS only still work for now because I have made my own fork of their no-longer-supported iOS SDK.</p>
<p>Sorry to not have a better answer, but it’s on Evernote.</p>

<p>It would appear Evernote do not provide a way for Drafts to integrate with them.</p>
