    <title>Send Draft to OmniFocus Task include text in &quot;Note&quot; of the task</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/send-draft-to-omnifocus-task-include-text-in-note-of-the-task/11522</link>
    <description>Hi All,

I am using the script below to take a line in Draft that starts with a - and sending it to OmniFocus as a new task with the correct tag. This works really well. What I would like to add is the ability to have the script put information into the &quot;Note&quot; section of the OmniFocus task. 

For example, 

If I write this in Drafts:

- Work with people to finish this project | I need to connect with Fred so he knows what to do.

After the right script was created, in OmniFocus it would look like this:

Task - Work with people to finish this project
Tag - Fred
Note - I need to connect with Fred so he knows what to do. 

In the text from Drafts I&#39;m using the &quot;|&quot; as the divider between the title of the Task and what should go into the Note. I am not married to this so if there is a better way to do this I&#39;m open to it.

Thank you!!!!

```
// Add  - Fred - *
function processDraft(p_strIdentifier, p_strNewPrefix = &quot;&quot;)
{
	// Check each line of the current draft
	for (let strLine of draft.lines)
	{
		// If the line starts with the task prefix, process it
		if (strLine.startsWith(p_strIdentifier))
		{
			// Build and call the URL
			let cb = CallbackURL.create();
			cb.baseURL = &quot;omnifocus:///add&quot;;
			cb.addParameter(&quot;name&quot;, p_strNewPrefix + strLine.substring(p_strIdentifier.length));
			cb.addParameter(&quot;note&quot;, draft.permalink);
			cb.addParameter(&quot;project&quot;, draft.displayTitle);
			cb.addParameter(&quot;context&quot;, &quot;üóí - Fred&quot;);
			cb.addParameter(&quot;autosave&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);
			cb.open();
		}
	}
	return;
}

//Call the function to process the draft with the identifier and the optional prefix to use in OmniFocus.
processDraft(&quot;-&quot;, &quot;üóí &quot;);

<p>I see one of these variable references seems to be missing an ‚Äús‚Äù from the end of the name. The <code>let</code> defines the variable, so that is the name that should be used throughout. Typo in the name simply refers to a different variable that may or may not exist.</p>

            <p>It is telling you that this line (15) is missing a closing parenthesis.</p>

<p>If you look at some of the other lines, you will see examples of where it is correct</p>

            <p>you need several things to achieve what you need. I‚Äôm not a very experienced javascript user so there might be a more efficient / elegant solution for your problem.<br>
Here is what I would do (attention i just edited tthis online and did not test it so there may be some typos or syntax issues.:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">const taskNoteDivider = "|";

// Add  - Fred - *
function processDraft(p_strIdentifier, p_strNewPrefix = "")
{
	// Check each line of the current draft
	for (let strLine of draft.lines)
	{
		// If the line starts with the task prefix, process it
		if (strLine.startsWith(p_strIdentifier))
		{
			// check if the divider is included in the task
			let taskName = "";
			let taskNote = "";
			if(strLine.includes(taskNoteDivider){
				// split the line into the task name and the content for the note
				let lineContent = p_strNewPrefix + strLine.substring(p_strIdentifier.length);
				let lineParts = lineContent.split(taskNoteDivider);
				taskName = lineParts[0];
				taskNote = linePart[1] + "\n" + draft.permalink;
			} else {
				taskName =  p_strNewPrefix + strLine.substring(p_strIdentifier.length);
				taskNote = draft.permalink;
			}
			// Build and call the URL
			let cb = CallbackURL.create();
			cb.baseURL = "omnifocus:///add";
			cb.addParameter("name", taskName);
			cb.addParameter("note", taskNote);
			cb.addParameter("project", draft.displayTitle);
			cb.addParameter("context", "üóí - Fred");
			cb.addParameter("autosave", "true");
			cb.open();
		}
	}
	return;
}

//Call the function to process the draft with the identifier and the optional prefix to use in OmniFocus.
processDraft("-", "üóí ");
