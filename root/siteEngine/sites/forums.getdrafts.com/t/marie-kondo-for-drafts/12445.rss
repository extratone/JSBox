    <description>I recently discovered a post by sylumer describing his system for creating a menu for actions. This works something like an Action Group within an Action Group. Using it, I went from chaos to a single, well-organized Action Group comprising 13 menus providing access to nearly 100 different actions.

The improvement in useability is enormous.</description>

    Awesome thanks. Follow up question: after I make my buttons how do I get them to run the specific Drafts action?
