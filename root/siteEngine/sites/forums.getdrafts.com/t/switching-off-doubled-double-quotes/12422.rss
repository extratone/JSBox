    <title>Switching off doubled double quotes?</title>
    <link>https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/switching-off-doubled-double-quotes/12422</link>
    <description>In Drafts on iOS when I type a single &quot; character (double quotes) I get two double quotes with the cursor between them. This is _somewhat_ convinient, but most of the time it throws me off and means that due to corrections I have to do rather more then less typing/editing work...

Is there any way to switch this off? (It must be an app-specific setting, because other apps to not do this.)</description>

            <p>Look in editor settings at the settings for your syntax. Ensure that you disable auto-match.</p>
