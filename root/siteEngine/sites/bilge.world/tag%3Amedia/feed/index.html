            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Patel Clouds Theme in the Chat Background Tool&#xA;&#xA;How I’ve used Telegram as
                the ultimate cross-platform Universal Clipboard, file sharing service, and more.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio

                it or not, I, too originally sought the Russian-owned, cross-platform-as-hell messaging service for
                “privacy” - or perhaps solitude would be more apt. It was in 2017, amidst the shock that the Tump
                Presidency was actually going to happen , that I happened to hear about his pick for Secretary of
                Education, Betsy DeVos, whom had just 18 months prior led myself and some twenty thousand other poor
                souls in a most capitalist prayer to the Christian God for prosperity at her pyramid scheme’s ultimate
                “superbowl” gathering in Cincinatti. I had decided to “infiltrate” AMWAY under the ridiculous assumption
                that I might be able to contribute some new insight in writing critically about what I might witness.
                (In truth, I found my experiences that summer so utterly traumatic, existentially, that I never was able
                to do so.) I don’t know what consequences of her ascension to the Lord of American Schooling I expected
                to happen, but I was pretty hysterical about it - that is, more unhumorously alarmed about some grander
                world happening as I’d ever been by a long shot. For the first and only time in memory, I felt compelled
                to take some sort of malicious, obscured action - to organize somehow for a purpose other than to be
                publicly critical of this person, and to use my knowledge about digital media to the fullest possible
                extent to scrutinize her administration’s every movement and to be prepared, even, to take some sort of
                real action if she… well, I don’t know. I didn’t know anything, really, about anti-government
                organization, generally, but I was not acting rationally in the slightest.&#xA;&#xA;White Sapphire&#xA;&#xA;I’m
                bringing this up for a few reasons, and the fact that the very first digital decision of my personal
                hysteria was to set up a private Telegram channel is telling, though I can’t recall just how much or how
                little I actually knew about it at the time. I launched myself back to the channel’s very beginning
                (easier to do with regular URLs than in any other service I’ve ever encountered,) but was only able to
                bring myself to dig just long enough to grab the utterly absurd photograph above… Though I certainly did
                not consider myself actively interested in automation at the time, Telegram’s infamous bot ecosystem
                proved so prevalent (and accessible,) that I was able to configure at least three bots on that channel
                within days of first establishing it: a repeater hooked to DeVos’ Twitter account, an RSS-powered bot
                watching the main feed of a website set up by Senator Elizabeth Warren called DeVos Watch, and another
                republishing everything from the Department of Education’s press releases feed. &#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/ammnontet/status/1449594872139186181&#xA;&#xA;Was
                any of it genuinely useful in helping me maintain Action Readiness in hypothetical defense of American
                education? Most certainly not. It was, however, genuinely comforting to have such diligent, automated
                minions keeping watch - to have a centralized, private, reliable, and purely-chronological feed of
                information in a super-handy location, regardless of whether or not it was usable. As I began to
                unconsciously integrate Telegram into my day-to-day online life on both of my PCs and my iPhone, the
                usefulness of my private channel for other applications became rapidly apparent. On iOS, not even
                dedicated file managers like DEVONthink are capable (or willing might be a more accurate term) of
                handling the diversity of data Telegram will happily pass on for you, especially through the Share
                Sheet.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1442554265956986882&#xA;&#xA;Drafting&#xA;&#xA;I
                have used this “flow” so extensively for so long that it has come to define the whole of the abstract
                method in my muscle memory. Observe me browsing the web on my phone in an exhausted or particularly
                distractible state and you’d probably catch at least one or two completely irrational, inexplicable
                instances of sharing to my “Saved Messages” Telegram channel, which would be problematic for just about
                any other link-saving service. Add too many links to Safari’s Read Later list and you’ll end up crashing
                the browser on your Mac. I don’t even feel comfortable sending links willy nilly to the brilliant
                bookmark managing/curatorial service Raindrop, these days, after finding out that my Reading List feed
                has actual daily followers, but there are zero consequences to sending ultimately-worthless or duplicate
                links to my personal Telegram channel, which has no content limit and is instantly and competently
                searchable.&#xA;&#xA;Send to Telegram Drafts Action&#xA;&#xA;Over the years, I’ve discovered a bunch of
                other uses for the Saved Messages channel. As demonstrated in the screenshots embedded above, the Send
                to Telegram Action for my writing app, Drafts, utilizes Telegram for iOS’ Universal Links support (in
                the format tg://…) to instantly send the whole text of the current document in Drafts to a Telegram
                channel of one’s choice. I suspect this was intended to streamline posting for admins of public
                channels, but I’ve used it to quickly “back up” work as well as to transfer edits directly to my
                (Windows-running) PC. By adding &amp;to=+my phone number] to the end of the action’s URL, I was able to
                remove the single, unnecessary step of choosing the destination chat. Because text messages are
                automatically split at 5000 characters, though, I usually depend on the [Share as Markdown File Action
                (the output of which I also send to Saved Messages through the Share Sheet) for the latter function.
                Anecdotally I’ve also used this method literally just to inspect unknown content passed to the Share
                Sheet because it’s often faster than Quick Look to share to my Saved Messages channel and then
                immediately open it in the app. (Hilarious, I suppose. Mostly sad, these days.)&#xA;&#xA;I found my
                inspiration for this Post in replying to a thread on the Automators.fm Discourse forum regarding a
                Windows equivlalent to the same Mac/iOS/iPadOS app Drafts mentioned above. I suppose my reply was a bit
                off-topic, in retrospect, but still worth including:&#xA;&#xA; I have been using Telegram, of all things
                for years. Notably, if you hit Ctrl + 0 from anywhere in the Windows client, you and your cursor are
                taken to the compose field beneath your personal &#34;Saved Messages&#34; channel, which is searchable,
                has an extremely high per-message character limit (after which it just automatically splits,) and is
                ridiculously reliable in saving &#34;drafts&#34; live as you&#39;re typing. As in... I have actively
                tried to lose characters by killing the application and then logging in on my phone and have yet to
                accomplish losing a single one (among other advantages: zero formatting added to plain text by default -
                not even line breaks - no total file limit and 2GB per file limit uploads, absurdly cross-platform,
                literally more reliable than SMS in poor network conditions.) You can immediately reenter a sent message
                with ↑ to edit, copy it, escape with just Esc and then paste to start a new revision. &#xA;&#xA;The
                feature within Telegram that makes this whole usecase worthwhile was introduced in June, 2016, and is
                entitled - appropriately - “Drafts.” Unlike the Drafts function in Twitter’s various native clients, for
                instance, Telegram’s really is impossible to fool, though it’s not perfect. Markdown formatting support
                is inconsistent across Telegram clients - the iOS app being the most woeful - and the few keyboard
                shortcuts the app supports on iPad are not supported whatsoever on iPhone.&#xA;&#xA;Universal Clipboard&#xA;&#xA;Users
                familiar with the MacOS + iOS + iPadOS ecosystem should be well-acquainted with “Universal Clipboard,”
                which instantly synchronizes clipboard content across Apple devices. More recently, Android + Windows
                users have supposedly had access to an equivalent functionality. To my knowledge, though, truly
                cross-platform clipboard sync has yet to be realized. As someone who’s used iOS and Windows regularly -
                along with Linux, occasionally - for more than a decade, now, I’d put my full weight behind Telegram as
                the best available solution from (far too much) personal experience.&#xA;&#xA;Security Considerations in
                Telegram for iOS&#xA;&#xA;When first entering a new system, real or virtual, regardless of OS, my very
                first step upon completion of its setup process has for years been to install Telegram, largely because
                all of my passwords for any/all given services are huge - 30+ characters, at least - and complex enough
                that typing them out is both tricky and absurdly time-consuming. Authorizing a new Telegram client,
                however, is as simple as entering a one-time numeric passcode or scanning a QR code. Managing logged-in
                sessions (see: the far right screenshot embedded above) is quick, reliable, and includes a handy button
                to kill all but the current session. Thanks to these considerations, I feel quite comfortable sending
                myself passwords in Telegram, including .csv exports of whole password vaults, when it’s appropriate,
                even when working on systems I do not own. For this function, I can’t think of any other
                service/software capable of replacing Telegram.&#xA;&#xA;For day-to-day hyperlink sharing across my
                platforms, a variety of alternatives continue to come and go. The “Send to device]” features represented
                throughout the palette of available web browsers - Firefox, Opera, Edge Chromium, Chrome, etc. - aren’t
                exactly reliable, in my experience. Most recently, I discovered a service specific to Hewlett Packard
                machines called “[QuickDrop,” which - along with its accompanying iOS app - does indeed allow me to send
                files, links, and text between my iPhone and Big Boy HP tower, though even my brief testing was filled
                with inexplicable prompts to reauthenticate and intermittent hangups, neither of which lend easily to
                regular use. I still maintain high hopes for Snapdrop, which allows devices to share files and text over
                a local network from within any web browser, but it, too, is prone to frustrating hangups.&#xA;&#xA;Drake
                Telegram Joke&#xA;&#xA;File Transfer &amp; Cloud Backup&#xA;&#xA;Amidst the saga of my failed move to
                Portland spanning 2017-2019, I ended up losing all of my physical file storage - my old desktop and its
                hard drive, as well as 3 external drives containing a bunch of raw video I probably wouldn’t have gotten
                around to using, anyway, site backups for Extratone, and who knows what else. This loss taught me many
                grand, metaphysical life lessons (I hope,) but more practically, it affirmed a (admittedly gluttonous)
                truth about digital assets: if one truly wishes to make a file permanent, they must back it up in as
                many different places as possible. Perhaps the single most durable of these in my own computing life to
                date has been Telegram, which still has no per-account file upload limit and a per-file size limit of
                two gigabytes. The amount of pre-2019 work I’ve recovered solely thanks to Telegram is too great to
                enumerate here, but a rough draft of my 2018 Thankful for Bandcamp Mix comes immediately to mind.&#xA;&#xA;How
                exactly the service is able to maintain this virtually unrestricted storage, infrastructurally, borders
                on don’t want to know status. My own net server impact as a user is fairly difficult to estimate, but
                I’d bet real paper currency it’s between 50 and 100 GB, the vast majority of which I uploaded several
                years ago. Within any mainstream cloud file storage service - Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, iCloud, etc. -
                the cost of storing that amount over time would have added up to a not-insignificant chunk of change. I
                don’t want to advocate for Telegram as a cloud storage replacement for loaded cheapskates, but for
                working-class users on a $0 budget, it can be counted upon to keep large files in a relatively
                shareable, ultra cross-platform, and super-accessible manner. Students, especially, should take note.&#xA;&#xA;Local
                Visibility and Voice Notes Publishing in Telegram for iOS&#xA;&#xA;Community&#xA;&#xA;At this point in
                my life, I must acknowledge to both readers and myself that I am completely inept at community
                organization. Especially when it comes to grand suggestions about how I suppose online communities might
                be ideally-run or just better served by particular software environments and configurations, I have
                literally received zero positive feedback, and not because I haven’t spent significant time positing
                publicly within the space. I spent the first half of my twenties trying to Peter Pan an independent
                online music magazine into existence, written by fresh-minded youths on the fringe at 140% throttle and
                managed to accomplish startlingly little for my all my invested time and gumption. The relevant
                component of that tale was a significant and all-out commitment from the beginning to run the whole
                project entirely within Discord. &#xA;&#xA;The one absent activity throughout my years of Telegram use -
                save for intermittent correspondence during one relationship - has been messaging other users. I managed
                to find and participate in a few group chats - “Telegram iOS Talk” and It&#39;s FOSS&#39; official
                channel, notably - in my preparation/research for this post. I’ve discovered plenty of new clever bits,
                like the button to jump to one’s nearest mention in a chat. I’ve also done my best to actually apply
                some much-needed administrative attention to my years-old attempt at creating the definitive
                location-based local group chat for the Mid-Missouri area where I live. Truthfully… It hasn’t exactly
                gone as I’d hoped, but the failures have been all my own. I have yet to find a satisfactory balance in
                terms of moderation bots, so I’ve (as of this writing) resorted to manually removing the (significant)
                spam bot traffic by hand. Also, I must admit that I’ve never had to do so more than once or twice on
                Extratone’s public Discord, despite how much more circulation its public, open invite links have
                received.&#xA;&#xA;In the past few weeks, I’ve had the privilege of watching MacStories relaunch their
                premium membership program, Club MacStories, on their incredible bespoke CMS. Part of this launch
                included their first exclusive community space, on Discord, which has been deeply rewarding for me,
                personally, but has also highlighted some serious limitations of that service which I not-so-long-ago
                advocated so heavily for. Namely, hyperlinks to specific messages within Discord are a hopelessly
                problematic endeavor. Even for a public server like Extratone’s, navigating to a message link like this
                example will require any and all users to log in to Discord on the web, which - on mobile devices,
                especially - seems to struggle to navigate to the precise position of the subject message after you’ve
                successfully done so. Slack’s public message links are smart enough at least to prompt users to open
                them Slack for iOS, but Telegram’s system for message links in public channels and groups makes both
                services look daft.&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA; source src=&#34;https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/Voice%20Notes/DiscordFuckery.mp3&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;Telegram
                message IDs are purely chronological from their channel/group chat’s creation - the first message in a
                channel or group chat is 1 and the 15th is 15. Together with the simplicity of channel/group chat IDs,
                which are just their alphanumeric @ names, this format makes URL schemes for Telegram message links
                super malleable and easy to understand. The sixth message posted in the @extratone channel, for
                instance, can be found at https://t.me/extratone/6, which even those without Telegram installed can view
                natively within their web browser. Within Telegram clients, said links are ultra-responsive, regardless
                of whether or not one had previously “joined” the channel or group containing the message. &#xA;&#xA;Orange
                Noir Telegram Theme by Valespace&#xA;&#xA;In MacStories’ case, there’s another essential point of
                reference. When I pinged the staff in their Discord regarding their experiences running their
                now-abandoned Telegram channel, John Voorhees replied:&#xA;&#xA; I don&#39;t really have anything to say
                about Telegram one way or the other. We ran it for a short time 5 years ago as an experiment and it didn&#39;t
                stick.&#xA;&#xA;I wasn’t yet a subscriber in those days, but little details like behind-the-scenes voice
                messages are definitely missed. Federico’s initial audio introduction describes a potential for the
                channel I wish more readers had enjoyed. They’re much more intimate, even, than the publication’s new
                exluclusive Town Hall events on Discord, which doesn’t make much sense, I know. &#xA;&#xA;Live Streams
                and Video Chats&#xA;&#xA;Streaming&#xA;&#xA;Admittedly, another attention-grabbing feature that
                contributed to my finally getting around to this Post was the introduction of &#34;Live Streams&#34; for
                channels and groups (really just a slight augmentation of their &#34;Voice Chats 2.0&#34; features) at
                the very end of this past August. Discord, of course, was way ahead of Telegram in implementing Voice
                Chats and Screen Sharing back in October of 2017, and it&#39;s long since become one of the services&#39;
                core features. However, recording live content of any kind is not natively supported, though there is a
                handy utility bot named Craig who can accomplish this for you. For the sake of transparency, I should
                admit that not a single one of my live streams on Discord has actually included any viewership, but I
                have participated in a handful of others’ and viewed a couple dozen.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1448837428534521858&#xA;&#xA;For
                the past few months or so, participating in any sort of voice or video chat in Discord desktop has led
                to a spectacular relaunch loop that can only be solved by reinstalling the application, entirely. It’s
                not that Discord for iOS’ now full support for such streaming - both in terms of participation and
                simple viewership - isn’t impressive, but honestly, Telegram for iOS’ superiority should be immediately
                obvious to anyone who’s tried them both, recently. Not just in pure capacity’s sense, but in moderation
                tools, shared link customization, and, obviously, native recording support. I’ve embedded two recordings
                of different test streams of mine, below. The first (embedded in YouTube form,) was streamed from both
                my Surface Laptop 2 and iPhone 12 Pro Max.&#xA;&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhXZZBl0fn8&#xA;&#xA;The
                second is a very brief recording (in native form directly from The Psalms’ GitHub Repo) of a stream I
                did just from the share screen function of my phone, in the wrong orientation.&#xA;&#xA;video controls&#xA;
                source src=&#34;https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/video/TelegramiOSLiveStreamTest.mp4&#34;&#xA;/video&#xA;&#xA;Below
                is a screenshot of the recorded file’s metadata (as provided by Telegram for Windows.) &#xA;&#xA;Telegram
                Live Stream Meta&#xA;&#xA;As you might note, there’s definitely something to be desired from the quality
                of Telegram’s stream recordings, especially in its included audio. I find it a bit strange that it’s
                recorded in 48 kHz just to be compressed down to 46kbps. When you’ve stopped a recording, you’ll receive
                both the video file and just the extracted audio in an .ogg file. Unfortunately, the latter is no less
                compressed than it is combined in the video file. (Both are sent to one&#39;s Saved Messages channel
                immediately upon stopping a recording, from where they can be forwarded virtually anywhere.) Aside from
                a boost in audio quality, though, Discord’s default 720p base resolution is matched by Telegram. Via
                server boosts, this figure can be upgraded significantly, though the end result is quite costly.
                According to a not necessarily trustworthy site, accounting for Discord’s recent reduction in boost
                requirements, here’s the pricing laydown to boost a server (per month:) &#xA;&#xA; …a total of $34.93
                for Level 2 and $69.86 for Level 3. That’s $24.45 for Level 2 and $48.90 for Level 3 for Nitro
                subscribers.&#xA;&#xA;Among quite a few other abilities, here are the extracted audio/video requirements
                per server level only:&#xA;&#xA;128kbps audio/720p video upped to 60fps&#xA;256kbps audio/1080p 60fps
                video&#xA;384kpbs audio/no video boost&#xA;&#xA;So, if I had the spare change to maintain a level 2
                boost for Extratone’s Discord server, myself, I could do so for $34.93 per month, which would allow me
                to stream (not necessarily record) in 1080p/60fps video and 256kbps audio to up to 50 viewers (as of
                this writing.) Theoretically, at no cost, I can stream with virtually identical features (though I
                prefer Telgram&#39;s) to my Telegram channel to infinitely many users in 1280p/30fps with absurdly
                low-quality audio and share/manipulate recordings natively/instantly from within any Telegram client. If
                I were All Powerful, I would make all the members of my &#34;Family Tech Support&#34; iMessage group
                install Telegram on their devices so we could use it, instead. I would also make them collectively
                attend occasional live streams, where they could ask questions verbally of my demonstrations sharing my
                own screen, or even share their own screens to demonstrate an issue or provide context for a question.
                The reality, though, is that I do not expect any sort of anticipation for my personal live help events
                on any platform, which innately suggests Telegram over Discord, I&#39;d argue, for when I do stream such
                content, given its total lack of investment.&#xA;&#xA;Location Sharing in Telegram for iOS&#xA;&#xA;Location
                Sharing&#xA;&#xA;One of Telegram&#39;s most unique (and potentially powerful, I believe) community
                features is Live Location Sharing on its mobile apps. Borned by Siberian native developer Roman Pushkin,
                LibreTaxi is the single truly exciting open ridesharing alternative I&#39;ve ever encountered. As an
                item for CBC radio from 2015 (among other assorted coverage compiled here as of July, 2017) explains, it
                utilizes Telegram&#39;s live location sharing functions to act as a decentralized Uber/Lyft alternative
                in the form of a bot, which connects users needing a ride with users providing them, free of any fees or
                service charges. Discourse surrounding LibreTaxi has been silent for years, but this channel tracking
                all LibreTaxi orders in realtime is proof that it really is helping folks get around.&#xA;&#xA;audio

                for the persistence of Live location-sharing, I can vouch for its reliability on the Android side, at
                least, as per my aforementioned experience with a partner who used Telegram and shared their location
                with me for both safety and convenience. As someone with the most immense possible privilege regarding
                safety and dating, I would also like to suggest sharing one&#39;s live location with a private Telegram
                group chat with friends as an alternative to services like Tinder&#39;s Noonlight.&#xA;&#xA;Chat Export
                in Telegram Desktop&#xA;&#xA;Permanence&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;ve long evangelized (and extensively used) Alexey
                Golub&#39;s Discord Chat Exporter to make beautiful, stylized archives of Discord channels and/or entire
                servers for safekeeping. Telegram&#39;s native Chat Export Tool came just a year after Alexey pushed
                version 1.0 of the tool to GitHub, in August of 2018. In features, they&#39;re very similar utilities:
                both can export in either stylized HTML or data-only JSON formats between infinitely-configurable
                time/date constraints. Again, I wouldn’t know how much external backup of community activity actually
                weighs in the day-to-day operations of large online communities. I know I personally find it comforting
                to have a swift, polished method of exporting text, especially, living in this era of blatant disregard
                for users of suddenly-abandoned online services.&#xA;&#xA;TG Colors&#xA;&#xA;Transparency Opacity&#xA;&#xA;One
                of my primary justifications for the time spent in composing this Post has to do with the
                immediately-available discourse surrounding Telegram on the web, which is wholly incomplete, at best.
                The main obstruction, from my perspective, is the subject of encryption. Even within publications as
                legitimate and frankly out-of-scope as Forbes, one can find an article like my chosen example, from
                February of this year, entitled &#34;No, Don’t Quit WhatsApp To Use Telegram Instead—Here’s Why.&#34; It
                was written to address a mass &#34;exodus&#34; of users from WhatsApp after a grandiose
                misunderstanding(?) of its Privacy Policy caused a noisy controversy (catalyzed by Idiot Melon,
                himself.) I&#39;ve been unable to find the added/altered text, itself, in my brief reading, but it&#39;s
                not as if the happening wasn&#39;t thoroughly covered elsewhere. It&#39;s not that I doubt the expertise
                of &#34;Cybersecurity Expert Zak Doffman&#34; when he notes &#34;Telegram’s cloud-based architecture is
                a serious risk when compared to the end-to-end default encryption deployed by Signal and WhatsApp, which
                also uses Signal’s protocol,&#34; nor that I do not believe the following details are as true as truth
                gets:&#xA;&#xA; All group messages on Telegram are only encrypted between your device and Telegram’s
                cloud, your message history is stored on Telegram’s cloud, and if you (unwisely) transfer your WhatsApp
                chat history to Telegram, then this is also stored on its cloud. Make you sure understand that Telegram
                has the decryption keys to any of your data that you store on its cloud...&#xA;&#xA;To this argument and
                the many variations of it present in Telegram for iOS&#39; App Store reviews, obscure German PeerTube
                servers, and even within public chats on Telegram, itself, my formal response for the record is: Okay!
                Affirmative! Received and understood! I must acknowledge - given my own introduction to the service,
                narrated above - that Telegram&#39;s brand is vaguely associated with privacy and security. I can see
                that the second of nine duckies in the Ducky Grid on the root of telegram.org sits above the subhead
                &#34;Private&#34; and a caption with the following claim: &#34;Telegram messages are heavily encrypted
                and can self-destruct.&#34; (The seventh ducky&#39;s subhead is &#34;Secure.&#34;) Continuing on in
                Doffman&#39;s Forbes article, we find an overview of several vulnerabilities found throughout Telegram&#39;s
                native clients by Dhiraj Mishra - surely they with the most ghastly typographical preferences in all of
                cybersecurity - on their blog, Input Zero. The specific example hyperlinked concerns a bug in the MacOS
                client that resulted in &#34;the application leak[ing] the sandbox path where [a sent audio or video
                message] is stored in &#39;.mp4&#39; file.&#34; (The whole of the ghastly-typewritten summary is
                embedded below in screenshot form.)&#xA;&#xA;Telegram Privacy - InputZero&#xA;&#xA;Just to be clear, I
                am being sincere when I acknowledge that these are genuinely problematic issues that no doubt affected
                real Telegram users who depend upon its Secret Chat function. Even something so benign as the file path
                to local media storage on my device is not something I&#39;d want piggybacking my otherwise-anonymous,
                NDA- and/or law-breaking messages to a journalist, for instance, but frankly, I don&#39;t know of any
                journalists who maintain public Telegram contacts, anyway. Come to think of it, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve
                ever seen a Telegram username publicly associated with a journalist. Indeed, the overwhelming majority
                of anonymous modern messenger service tip lines advertised by news organizations and news people which I&#39;ve
                come across have all linked to Signal. In this particular case, then, Mr. Elon’s advice is sound.&#xA;&#xA;The
                question I would like to surface: what if I have no use for encryption or privacy across my purposes for
                Telegram? All the channels I have ever engaged with have been public, and those private ones I’ve come
                across have either been shady crypto spam channels or shady porn channels. I realize this doesn’t
                exactly reflect positively on Telegram’s community, but - as I argued regarding Discord, long ago - why
                let the community or even the app’s branding, itself, confine how you use it as a utility?&#xA;&#xA;A
                Hearty Foundation&#xA;&#xA;My thinking while drafting this argument kept returning to a single, simple
                realization: in age, Telegram is just two years ahead of Discord, yet the various software distributed
                by the two organizations for their respective services represent quite disparate opinions in design
                terms. Discord&#39;s desktop &#34;application&#34; is an Electron app - Telegram&#39;s is virtually pure
                C++. Telegram&#39;s iOS app is mostly written in Objective-C (I&#39;m to assume the 30.8% Swift code
                number on the repo as of this writing is mostly comprised of its widgets/other recent iOS-specific
                integrations,) while Discord&#39;s is mostly ???. That is, because Discord&#39;s software is proprietary
                and the source is closed, all I can tell you is that it was written in React Native as of December,
                2018. What I can tell you is that the current build of Discord for iOS on the App Store weighs in at
                153.2 MB - significantly less than Telegram&#39;s 185.1 MB. As I&#39;ve noted plenty of times this year,
                I am not a software developer and therefore I can&#39;t promise you an app&#39;s initial payload size is
                actually all that relevant, but I was surprised to see Telegram wasn&#39;t slimmer than Discord, given
                how the two apps behave and my previous experiences with the platform, this year. &#xA;&#xA;Storage
                Management - Telegram for iOS&#xA;&#xA;Returning to the topic of their age… In its eight operating
                years, Telegram has embarked upon - and actually completed! - a gargantuan amount of projects.
                Telegraph, the CMS, its Web, Android, and Linux clients, embeddedable comments widgets, its online theme
                creation tool, and on and on. Across their various types, Telegram’s software is universally simple,
                frugal, robust, and easy-to-use. Frankly, by contrast, Discord has done nothing? Though you’ll find
                openly-available solutions to accomplish much of what you can on Telegram in terms of moderation and
                other utilitarian concerns, like the aforementioned Craig bot, they are all the work of third-parties.
                While Discord the company is much more transparently profiled on the web than “Telegram FZ LLC,” the
                latter’s actual work is very well documented across GitHub. &#xA;&#xA;Telegram Desktop in Windows 11&#xA;&#xA;If
                you’ve stuck with me this far, perhaps it’s not too much to ask that we retreat a bit and ask ourselves
                what we’d truly like prioritized in community chat software for 2021. I really do show my age in my
                bias, here, as someone just old enough to have had extensive experience using IRC, I think there’s a
                less-than-adequately discussed division happening which its successors might benefit dwelling on. IRC
                was extremely frugal and it was easy to find a freeware or FOSS IRC client for one’s given platform
                which was well-optimized to sit in the background of their desktop operating system, completely
                untouched and barely acknowledged visually for days… weeks… months at a time. It was easy to find
                oneself a member of a dozen or so IRC channels for specific interests, projects, or organizations
                averaging a dozen or so actual updates/pots per day, each. It was distinctly low pressure - many of my
                channel memberships functioned more like a wire service or, much more contemporarily, like an RSS
                aggregator, than a local party line.&#xA;&#xA;Telegram for iOS Sharing and Notifications&#xA;&#xA;As I
                see it, the ultimate shift dividing those solutions from these is the big fucking obvious one: IRC was
                conceived in a world where computers were mostly static objects associated by their intended use and
                physical dimensions with the referential, unmoving waypoints around which we orbited (the kitchen
                counter, the desk in your study at home, parallel series of workstations within the public library,
                etc.) The entirely contrasted needs of community engagement on a handset should have - in my opinion -
                done much more to break apart these communal contexts than they have. As prolifically and extensively as
                I have used Discord for iOS since before its official release, even, it is hopelessly compromised by its
                loyalty to the PC gamer’s paradigm. My 12 Pro Max is not just capable of keeping 100 Discord channels
                up-to-date in the background as I move about the world - it is all too fucking eager, and for not a one
                rational explanation. Going on down this vector eventually leads to an adjacent argument I’ll name but
                otherwise save for later: it is literally over a decade past the time when we should have ceased
                celebrating the fact that mobile computers had matched and outdone desktop computers! We have to snap
                the fuck out of our obsession with lugging desktop computing alongside our persons and refocus entirely
                (once again) on exploring what “mobile computing” can/should mean, going forward. Please Gourd, help us
                do so ASAP.&#xA;&#xA;Unlike my heroes in most (if not all) of these tedious comparisons, I would not say
                Telegram is the single software manifestation of total clarity in direction within the subject, or
                anything, but in the area where it fails along with the rest of them, it has comprehensively iterated,
                invested in trial and error, and eventually produced tools that remedy the disparate gluttony. How
                swiftly and easily one can find one&#39;s installation full of media files, for instance, after any time
                spent exploring within its mobile apps.&#xA;&#xA;It very well could have been mostly chance that
                contributed to Telegram&#39;s current lead in terms of thoughtful design decisions and development
                investment toward mobile-first optimization. Perhaps it was their comparative longstanding Hype Famine,
                especially in the United States, these past few years. Maybe Discord hasn&#39;t built anything because
                they simply can&#39;t hear each other over the buzzwords overflowing their name in mainstream Discourse
                so abruptly thanks to The Big Virus. &#xA;&#xA;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;60&#34; src=&#34;https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&amp;mini=1&amp;light=1&amp;feed=%2FwiredUK%2Ftelegrams-pavel-durov-podcast-256%2F&#34;
                frameborder=&#34;0&#34; /iframe&#xA;&#xA;Telegram&#39;s story certainly stands out, though the voice of
                its creator, Pavel Durov, actually telling this story at length can now only be found on WIRED UK&#39;s
                MixCloud account, in episode 256 of their WIRED Podcast. Telegram was experiencing the peak of its
                presence in mainstream Western news media, who just would not let go of the fact that some leader of
                some terrorist organization recommended Telegram to someone for something at some point in time.
                Listening back, it&#39;s the nomadic &#34;decentralized&#34; beginnings of the organization - which I
                had forgotten entirely - which sounded a big, resonant Parallel Alarm in my brain: for very different
                reasons, Bandcamp also operating without an office (from a public library, charmingly,) at that time.
                &#xA;&#xA;&#34;Can there only be one winner in the messaging wars?&#34; asks David Rowan, which Pavel -
                in the deliberate, uncomfortable-sounding tone he uses throughout the interview - answers first noting a
                real truth for actual users: we tend to end up with a billion, each grouped generally by types of
                relationships. iMessage is for your family and local friends, Facebook Messenger is for your school
                group project, IRC and Element are for your insane, privacy-obsessed Linux friends, and Telegram is for
                unsolicited video chats of worm tubs.&#xA;&#xA;For more, up-to-the-minute information on Telegram as

                I still have not accepted this, by the way. I’m still back there.&#xA;[2] If I were to be 100% sincere,
                I might ask you to consider that this (hilariously brief) intent was a method of coping with the great
                existential truths I was facing for the first time.&#xA;3] I definitey was, though. For whatever reason,
                I do not remember associating the term “automation” with such activities, but I just found the “receipt”
                for my “purchase” of [IFTTT for iOS… From July, 2013.&#xA;[4] I am currently working on a
                less-than-instant solution using iCloud and CopyQ’s clipboard sync function.&#xA;[5] I would’ve said
                “one can never have too many backups,” but the result of such thinking is ridiculously wasteful and not
                something I actually want to encourage.&#xA;[6] I&#39;m almost positive I&#39;ve heard of/been linked to
                this blog before, which is perhaps only notable in that I managed to keep my typographic opinions to
                myself.&#xA;[7] Not that the process of doing so could be any easier on Windows.&#xA;8] It’s also worth
                nothing that [word of screen sharing framerate issues was circulating at the time of this recording.&#xA;9]
                Simulcast services like [Happs - which still exists, astonishingly - offer an intriguing utility for
                those intending to stream regularly and wishing to do so across multiple platforms. It does not, at the
                moment, support either Telegram or Discord.&#xA;10] Speaking as someone with [actual extensive
                ridesharing experience, notably.&#xA;[11] Yes, there are some fellow Open Source Folks who’ve frankly
                struggled to let IRC go. It was an amazing protocol and will always be intertwined with the very first
                layed bricks of what we’d call the Social Web, but my friends… I sincerely think we should all try our
                hands at ham radio, instead. I think that would legitimately be a better use of our time than trying to
                implement two-factor authentication for IRC in this year of our spiteful Lourde 2021.&#xA;[12]
                Disparaging Telegram for this is akin to shitting on Google because it is or was almost certainly the
                Taliban&#39;s favorite search engine, no?&#xA;&#xA;a href=&#34;https://remark.as/p/bilge.world/telegram&#34;Discuss.../a&#xA;&#xA;#software

                    How I’ve used Telegram as the ultimate cross-platform Universal Clipboard, file sharing service, and
                    more.</h2>

                </p>

                <p>Believe it or not, I, too originally sought the Russian-owned, cross-platform-as-hell messaging
                    service for “privacy” – or perhaps <em>solitude</em> would be more apt. It was in 2017, amidst the
                    shock that the Tump Presidency was <em>actually going to happen</em> [^1], that I happened to hear
                    about his pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, whom had just 18 months prior led myself and
                    some twenty thousand other poor souls in a most capitalist prayer to the Christian God for
                    prosperity at her pyramid scheme’s ultimate “superbowl” gathering in Cincinatti. I had decided to
                    “infiltrate” AMWAY under the ridiculous assumption that I might be able to contribute some new
                    insight in writing critically about what I might witness. (In truth, I found my experiences that
                    summer so utterly traumatic, existentially, that I never was able to do so.) I don’t know what
                    consequences of her ascension to the Lord of American Schooling I expected to happen, but I was
                    pretty hysterical about it – that is, more unhumorously alarmed about some grander world happening
                    as I’d ever been by a long shot. For the first and only time in memory, I felt compelled to take
                    some sort of malicious, obscured action – to organize somehow for a purpose other than to be
                    publicly critical of this person, and to use my knowledge about digital media to the fullest
                    possible extent to scrutinize her administration’s every movement and to be prepared, even, to take
                    some sort of real action if she… well, I don’t know. I <em>didn’t</em> know anything, really, about
                    anti-government organization, generally, but I was not acting rationally in the slightest.[^2]</p>

                <p>I’m bringing this up for a few reasons, and the fact that the very first digital decision of my
                    personal hysteria was to set up a private Telegram channel is telling, though I can’t recall just
                    how much or how little I actually knew about it at the time. I launched myself back to the channel’s
                    very beginning (easier to do with regular URLs than in any other service I’ve ever encountered,) but
                    was only able to bring myself to dig just long enough to grab the utterly absurd photograph above…
                    Though I certainly did not consider myself actively <em>interested in automation</em> at the
                    time,[^3] Telegram’s infamous bot ecosystem proved so prevalent (and accessible,) that I was able to
                    configure at least three bots on that channel within days of first establishing it: a repeater
                    hooked to DeVos’ Twitter account, an RSS-powered bot watching the main feed of a website set up by
                    Senator Elizabeth Warren called <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/devos-watch"><em>DeVos
                        Watch</em></a>, and another republishing everything from <a

                <p>Was any of it genuinely useful in helping me maintain <em>Action Readiness</em> in hypothetical
                    defense of American education? Most certainly not. It was, however, genuinely <em>comforting</em> to
                    have such diligent, automated minions keeping watch – to have a centralized, private, reliable, and
                    purely-chronological feed of information in a super-handy location, regardless of whether or not it
                    was usable. As I began to unconsciously integrate Telegram into my day-to-day online life on both of
                    my PCs and my iPhone, the usefulness of my private channel for <em>other</em> applications became
                    rapidly apparent. On iOS, not even dedicated file managers like DEVONthink are capable (or <em>willing</em>
                    might be a more accurate term) of handling the diversity of data Telegram will happily pass on for
                    you, <em>especially</em> through the Share Sheet.</p>

                <h2 id="drafting">Drafting</h2>

                <p>I have used this “flow” so extensively for so long that it has come to define the whole of the
                    abstract method in my muscle memory. Observe me browsing the web on my phone in an exhausted or
                    particularly distractible state and you’d probably catch at least one or two completely irrational,
                    inexplicable instances of sharing to my “<a href="https://telegram.org/blog/albums-saved-messages">Saved
                        Messages</a>” Telegram channel, which would be problematic for just about any other link-saving
                    service. Add too many links to Safari’s Read Later list and you’ll end up crashing the browser on
                    your Mac. I don’t even feel comfortable sending links willy nilly to the brilliant bookmark
                    managing/curatorial service Raindrop, these days, after finding out that my <a
                            href="https://raindrop.io/davidblue/reading-list-13380406">Reading List feed</a> has <em>actual
                        daily followers</em>, but there are zero consequences to sending ultimately-worthless or
                    duplicate links to my personal Telegram channel, which has no content limit and is instantly and
                    competently searchable.</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/p3K96LiX.png" alt="Send to Telegram Drafts Action"/></p>

                <p>Over the years, I’ve discovered a bunch of other uses for the Saved Messages channel. As demonstrated
                    in the screenshots embedded above, the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E">Send to
                        Telegram Action</a> for my writing app, Drafts, utilizes Telegram for iOS’ Universal Links
                    support (in the format <code>tg://…</code>) to instantly send the whole text of the current document
                    in Drafts to a Telegram channel of one’s choice. I suspect this was intended to streamline posting
                    for admins of public channels, but I’ve used it to quickly “back up” work as well as to transfer
                    edits directly to my (Windows-running) PC. By adding <code>&amp;to=+[my phone number]</code> to the
                    end of the action’s URL, I was able to remove the single, unnecessary step of choosing the
                    destination chat. Because text messages are automatically split at 5000 characters, though, I
                    usually depend on the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1V4">Share as Markdown File
                        Action</a> (the output of which I also send to Saved Messages through the Share Sheet) for the
                    latter function. Anecdotally I’ve also used this method literally just to inspect unknown content
                    passed to the Share Sheet because it’s often <strong>faster than Quick Look</strong> to share to my
                    Saved Messages channel and then immediately open it in the app. (Hilarious, I suppose. Mostly sad,
                    these days.)</p>

                <p>I found my inspiration for this Post in replying to a <a
                        href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/equivalent-to-drafts-but-for-windows/6159">thread on the
                    Automators.fm Discourse forum</a> regarding a Windows equivlalent to the same Mac/iOS/iPadOS app
                    Drafts mentioned above. I suppose my reply was a bit off-topic, in retrospect, but still worth
                    including:</p>

                <blockquote><p>I have been using <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org/"><strong>Telegram</strong></a>,
                    of all things for years. Notably, if you hit Ctrl + 0 from <em>anywhere</em> in the Windows client,
                    you and your cursor are taken to the compose field beneath your personal “Saved Messages” channel,
                    which is searchable, has an extremely high per-message character limit (after which it just
                    automatically splits,) and is ridiculously reliable in saving “drafts” live as you&#39;re typing. As
                    in... I have actively tried to lose characters by killing the application and then logging in on my
                    phone and have yet to accomplish losing a single one (among other advantages: zero formatting added
                    to plain text by default – not even line breaks – no total file limit and <em>2GB</em> per file
                    limit uploads, absurdly cross-platform, literally more reliable than SMS in poor network
                    conditions.) You can immediately reenter a sent message with <code>↑</code> to edit, copy it, escape
                    with just <code>Esc</code> and then paste to start a new revision.</p></blockquote>

                <p>The feature within Telegram that makes this whole usecase worthwhile was introduced in <a
                        href="https://telegram.org/blog/drafts">June, 2016</a>, and is entitled – appropriately –
                    “Drafts.” Unlike the Drafts function in Twitter’s various native clients, for instance, Telegram’s
                    really is impossible to fool, though it’s not perfect. <a href="https://telegra.ph/markdown-07-07">Markdown
                        formatting support</a> is inconsistent across Telegram clients – the iOS app being the most
                    woeful – and the few keyboard shortcuts the app supports on iPad are not supported whatsoever on
                    iPhone.</p>

                <h2 id="universal-clipboard">Universal Clipboard</h2>

                <p>Users familiar with the MacOS + iOS + iPadOS ecosystem should be well-acquainted with “<a
                        href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209460">Universal Clipboard</a>,” which instantly
                    synchronizes clipboard content across Apple devices. More recently, Android + Windows users have
                    supposedly had access to an <a
                            href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/seamlessly-transfer-content-between-your-devices-8a0ead3c-2f15-1338-66ca-70cf4ae81fcb#WindowsVersion=Windows_10">equivalent
                        functionality</a>. To my knowledge, though, truly cross-platform clipboard sync has yet to be
                    realized.[^4] As someone who’s used iOS and Windows regularly – along with Linux, occasionally – for
                    more than a decade, now, I’d put my full weight behind Telegram as the best available solution from
                    (far too much) personal experience.</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Qim9gsZZ.png" alt="Security Considerations in Telegram for iOS"/></p>

                <p>When first entering a new system, real or virtual, regardless of OS, my very first step upon
                    completion of its setup process has for years been to install Telegram, largely because all of my
                    passwords for any/all given services are huge – 30+ characters, at least – and complex enough that
                    typing them out is both tricky and absurdly time-consuming. Authorizing a new Telegram client,
                    however, is as simple as entering a one-time numeric passcode or scanning a QR code. Managing
                    logged-in sessions (see: the far right screenshot embedded above) is quick, reliable, and includes a
                    handy button to kill all but the current session. Thanks to these considerations, I feel quite
                    comfortable sending myself passwords in Telegram, including .csv exports of whole password vaults,
                    when it’s appropriate, even when working on systems I do not own. For this function, I can’t think
                    of any other service/software capable of replacing Telegram.</p>

                <p>For day-to-day hyperlink sharing across my platforms, a variety of alternatives continue to come and
                    go. The “Send to [device]” features represented throughout the palette of available web browsers –
                    Firefox, Opera, Edge Chromium, Chrome, etc. – aren’t exactly reliable, in my experience. Most
                    recently, I discovered a service specific to Hewlett Packard machines called “<a
                            href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/solutions/quickdrop-photo-sharing-app.html">QuickDrop</a>,”
                    which – along with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hp-quickdrop/id1495071972">its
                        accompanying iOS app</a> – does indeed allow me to send files, links, and text between my iPhone
                    and Big Boy HP tower, though even my brief testing was filled with inexplicable prompts to
                    reauthenticate and intermittent hangups, neither of which lend easily to regular use. I still
                    maintain high hopes for <a href="https://snapdrop.net/">Snapdrop</a>, which allows devices to share
                    files and text over a <em>local</em> network from within any web browser, but it, too, is prone to
                    frustrating hangups.</p>

                <h2 id="file-transfer-cloud-backup">File Transfer &amp; Cloud Backup</h2>

                <p>Amidst the saga of my failed move to Portland spanning 2017-2019, I ended up losing <em>all</em> of
                    my physical file storage – my old desktop and its hard drive, as well as 3 external drives
                    containing a bunch of raw video I probably wouldn’t have gotten around to using, anyway, site
                    backups for <em>Extratone</em>, and who knows what else. This loss taught me many grand,
                    metaphysical life lessons (I hope,) but more practically, it affirmed a (admittedly gluttonous)
                    truth about digital assets: if one truly wishes to make a file permanent, they must back it up in as
                    many different places as possible.[^5] Perhaps the single most durable of these in my own computing
                    life to date has been Telegram, which still has no per-account file upload limit and a per-file size
                    limit of <em>two gigabytes</em>. The amount of pre-2019 work I’ve recovered solely thanks to
                    Telegram is too great to enumerate here, but a rough draft of my <a
                            href="https://pod.link/1437549809/episode/626a66d3f37807b69c59f56faa4d3b94">2018 Thankful
                        for Bandcamp Mix</a> comes immediately to mind.</p>

                <p>How exactly the service is able to maintain this virtually unrestricted storage, infrastructurally,
                    borders on <em>don’t want to know</em> status. My own net server impact as a user is fairly
                    difficult to estimate, but I’d bet real paper currency it’s between 50 and 100 GB, the vast majority
                    of which I uploaded several years ago. Within any mainstream cloud file storage service – Dropbox,
                    Google Drive, Box, iCloud, etc. – the cost of storing that amount <em>over time</em> would have
                    added up to a not-insignificant chunk of change. I don’t want to advocate for Telegram as a cloud
                    storage replacement for loaded cheapskates, but for working-class users on a $0 budget, it can be
                    counted upon to keep large files in a relatively shareable, ultra cross-platform, and
                    super-accessible manner. Students, especially, should take note.</p>

                <h2 id="community">Community</h2>

                <p>At this point in my life, I must acknowledge to both readers and myself that <strong>I am completely
                    inept at community organization</strong>. Especially when it comes to grand suggestions about how I
                    suppose online communities might be ideally-run or just better served by particular software
                    environments and configurations, I have literally received <em>zero</em> positive feedback, and not
                    because I haven’t spent significant time positing publicly within the space. I spent the first half
                    of my twenties trying to Peter Pan an independent online music magazine into existence, written by
                    fresh-minded youths on the fringe at 140% throttle and managed to accomplish startlingly little for
                    my all my invested time and gumption. The relevant component of that tale was a significant and
                    all-out commitment from the beginning to run the whole project entirely within Discord.</p>

                <p>The one absent activity throughout my years of Telegram use – save for intermittent correspondence
                    during one relationship – has been <em>messaging other users</em>. I managed to find and participate
                    in a few group chats – “<a href="https://t.me/TelegramiOStalk">Telegram iOS Talk</a>” and <a
                            href="https://t.me/itsfoss_official"><em>It&#39;s FOSS</em>&#39; official channel</a>,
                    notably – in my preparation/research for this post. I’ve discovered plenty of new clever bits, like
                    the button to jump to one’s nearest mention in a chat. I’ve also done my best to actually apply some
                    <a href="https://t.me/columbiamo/7774">much-needed administrative attention</a> to <a

                    removing the (significant) spam bot traffic by hand. Also, I must admit that I’ve never had to do so
                    more than once or twice on <em>Extratone</em>’s public Discord, despite how much more circulation
                    its public, open invite links have received.</p>

                <p>In the past few weeks, I’ve had the privilege of watching <em>MacStories</em> relaunch their premium
                    membership program, <em>Club MacStories</em>, on their incredible bespoke CMS. Part of this launch
                    included their first exclusive community space, on Discord, which has been deeply rewarding for me,
                    personally, but has also highlighted some serious limitations of that service which I
                    not-so-long-ago <a href="https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison">advocated so heavily for</a>.
                    Namely, <strong>hyperlinks to specific messages</strong> within Discord are a hopelessly problematic
                    endeavor. Even for a public server like <em>Extratone</em>’s, navigating to a message link <a
                            href="https://discord.com/channels/107272441889341440/107272441889341440/893958033401593898">like
                        this example</a> will require any and all users to log in to Discord on the web, which – on
                    mobile devices, especially – seems to struggle to navigate to the precise position of the subject
                    message after you’ve successfully done so. Slack’s public message links are smart enough at least to
                    prompt users to open them Slack for iOS, but Telegram’s system for message links in public channels
                    and groups makes both services look daft.</p>

                </p>

                <p>Telegram message IDs are purely chronological from their channel/group chat’s creation – the first
                    message in a channel or group chat is <code>1</code> and the 15th is <code>15</code>. Together with
                    the simplicity of channel/group chat IDs, which are just their alphanumeric @ names, this format
                    makes URL schemes for Telegram message links super malleable and easy to understand. The sixth
                    message posted in the <a href="https://t.me/extratone">@extratone channel</a>, for instance, can be
                    found at <a href="https://t.me/extratone/6">https://t.me/extratone/6</a>, which even those without
                    Telegram installed can view natively within their web browser. Within Telegram clients, said links
                    are ultra-responsive, regardless of whether or not one had previously “joined” the channel or group
                    containing the message.</p>

                <p>In <em>MacStories</em>’ case, there’s another essential point of reference. When I pinged the staff
                    in their Discord regarding their experiences running <a href="https://t.me/MacStories">their
                        now-abandoned Telegram channel</a>, John Voorhees replied:</p>

                <blockquote><p>I don&#39;t really have anything to say about Telegram one way or the other. We ran it
                    for a short time 5 years ago as an experiment and it didn&#39;t stick.</p></blockquote>

                <p>I wasn’t yet a subscriber in those days, but little details like <a
                        href="https://t.me/MacStories/281">behind-the-scenes voice messages</a> are definitely missed.
                    <a href="https://t.me/MacStories/39">Federico’s initial audio introduction</a> describes a potential
                    for the channel I wish more readers had enjoyed. They’re much more intimate, even, than the
                    publication’s new exluclusive Town Hall events on Discord, which doesn’t make much sense, I know.

                <p>Admittedly, another attention-grabbing feature that contributed to my finally getting around to this
                    Post was <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel">the introduction
                        of “Live Streams” for channels and groups</a> (really just a slight augmentation of their <a
                            href="https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats-on-steroids">“Voice Chats 2.0” features</a>) at
                    the very end of this past August. Discord, of course, was way ahead of Telegram in implementing
                    Voice Chats and Screen Sharing <a href="https://youtu.be/mMloc55o1jc">back in October of 2017</a>,
                    and it&#39;s long since become one of the services&#39; core features. However, <em>recording</em>
                    live content of any kind is not natively supported, though there is a <a href="https://craig.chat">handy
                        utility bot named Craig</a> who can accomplish this for you. For the sake of transparency, I
                    should admit that not a single one of my live streams on Discord has actually included any
                    viewership, but I have participated in a handful of others’ and viewed a couple dozen.</p>

                <p>For the past few months or so, participating in any sort of voice or video chat in Discord desktop
                    has led to <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1448837428534521858">a spectacular relaunch
                        loop</a> that can only be solved by reinstalling the application, entirely.[^7] It’s not that
                    Discord for iOS’ now full support for such streaming – both in terms of participation and simple
                    viewership – isn’t impressive, but honestly, <em>Telegram</em> for iOS’ superiority should be
                    immediately obvious to anyone who’s tried them both, recently. Not just in pure capacity’s sense,
                    but in moderation tools, shared link customization, and, obviously, native recording support. I’ve
                    embedded two recordings of different test streams of mine, below. <a
                            href="https://t.me/extratone/7054">The first</a> (embedded in <a
                            href="https://youtu.be/uhXZZBl0fn8">YouTube form</a>,) was streamed from both my Surface
                    Laptop 2 and iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>

                <p><a href="https://t.me/extratone/7196">The second</a> is a very brief recording (in native form <a
                        href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/video/TelegramiOSLiveStreamTest.mp4">directly
                    from <em>The Psalms</em>’ GitHub Repo</a>) of a stream I did <em>just</em> from the share screen
                    function of my phone, in the wrong orientation.[^8]</p>

                </video>

                <p>Below is a screenshot of the recorded file’s metadata (as provided by Telegram for Windows.)</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/oDQqSYHF.png" alt="Telegram Live Stream Meta"/></p>

                <p>As you might note, there’s definitely something to be desired from the quality of Telegram’s stream
                    recordings, especially in its included audio. I find it a bit strange that it’s recorded in 48 kHz
                    just to be compressed down to <em>46kbps</em>. When you’ve stopped a recording, you’ll receive both
                    the video file and just the extracted audio in an .ogg file. Unfortunately, the latter is no less
                    compressed than it is combined in the video file. (Both are sent to one&#39;s Saved Messages channel
                    immediately upon stopping a recording, from where they can be forwarded virtually anywhere.) Aside
                    from a boost in audio quality, though, Discord’s default 720p base resolution is matched by
                    Telegram. Via server boosts, this figure can be upgraded significantly, though the end result is
                    quite costly. According to <a href="https://clutchpoints.com/discord-server-boost-cost/">a not
                        necessarily trustworthy site</a>, accounting for Discord’s <a
                            href="https://www.facebook.com/discord/posts/4524749577592737">recent reduction in boost
                        requirements</a>, here’s the pricing laydown to boost a server (per month:)</p>

                <blockquote><p>…a total of $34.93 for Level 2 and $69.86 for Level 3. That’s $24.45 for Level 2 and
                    $48.90 for Level 3 for Nitro subscribers.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Among quite a few other abilities, here are the extracted audio/video requirements per server level
                    <strong>only</strong>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>128kbps audio/720p video upped to 60fps</li>
                    <li>256kbps audio/1080p 60fps video</li>
                    <li>384kpbs audio/no video boost</li>
                </ol>

                <p>So, if I had the spare change to maintain a level 2 boost for <em>Extratone</em>’s Discord server,
                    myself, I could do so for $34.93 per month, which would allow me to <em>stream</em> (not necessarily
                    <em>record</em>) in 1080p/60fps video and 256kbps audio to up to <a
                            href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151-Go-Live-and-Screen-Share">50
                        viewers</a> (as of this writing.) Theoretically, at no cost, I can stream with virtually
                    identical features (though I prefer Telgram&#39;s) to my Telegram channel to <a
                            href="https://telegram.org/blog/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel#unlimited-live-streams">infinitely
                        many users</a> in 1280p/30fps with absurdly low-quality audio and share/manipulate recordings
                    natively/instantly from within any Telegram client. If I were All Powerful, I would make all the
                    members of my “<a href="https://bilge.world/ios-15-family-review">Family Tech Support</a>” iMessage
                    group install Telegram on their devices so we could use it, instead. I would also make them
                    collectively attend occasional live streams, where they could ask questions verbally of my
                    demonstrations sharing my own screen, or even share their own screens to demonstrate an issue or
                    provide context for a question. The reality, though, is that I do not expect any sort of
                    anticipation for my personal live help events on any platform, which innately suggests Telegram over
                    Discord, I&#39;d argue, for when I <em>do</em> stream such content, given its total lack of
                    investment.[^9]</p>

                <p>One of Telegram&#39;s most unique (and potentially powerful, I believe) community features is <a

                    Borned by Siberian native developer <a href="https://twitter.com/romanpushkin">Roman Pushkin</a>,
                    LibreTaxi is the single truly exciting open ridesharing alternative I&#39;ve ever encountered.[^10]
                    As

                    explains, it utilizes Telegram&#39;s live location sharing functions to act as a decentralized
                    Uber/Lyft alternative in the form of <a href="https://telegram.me/libretaxi_bot">a bot</a>, which
                    connects users needing a ride with users providing them, free of any fees or service charges.
                    Discourse surrounding LibreTaxi has been silent for years, but <a

                    shared their location with me for both safety and convenience. As someone with the most immense
                    possible privilege regarding safety and dating, I would also like to suggest sharing one&#39;s live
                    location with a private Telegram group chat with friends as an alternative to services like <a

                    beautiful, stylized archives of Discord channels and/or entire servers for safekeeping. Telegram&#39;s
                    native <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/export-and-more">Chat Export Tool</a> came just a year
                    after Alexey pushed <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases/tag/1.0.0">version
                        1.0 of the tool to GitHub</a>, in August of 2018. In features, they&#39;re very similar
                    utilities: both can export in either stylized HTML or data-only JSON formats between
                    infinitely-configurable time/date constraints. Again, I wouldn’t know how much external backup of
                    community activity actually weighs in the day-to-day operations of large online communities. I know
                    I personally find it comforting to have a swift, polished method of exporting <em>text</em>,

                <p>One of my primary justifications for the time spent in composing this Post has to do with the
                    immediately-available discourse surrounding Telegram on the web, which is wholly incomplete, at
                    best. The main obstruction, from my perspective, is the subject of <strong>encryption</strong>. Even
                    within publications as legitimate and frankly out-of-scope as <em>Forbes</em>, one can find an
                    article like my chosen example, from February of this year, entitled “<a

                    but it&#39;s not as if the happening wasn&#39;t thoroughly covered elsewhere. It&#39;s not that I
                    doubt the expertise of “Cybersecurity Expert Zak Doffman” when he notes “Telegram’s cloud-based
                    architecture is a serious risk when compared to the end-to-end default encryption deployed by Signal
                    and WhatsApp, which also uses Signal’s protocol,” nor that I do not believe the following details
                    are as true as truth gets:</p>

                <blockquote><p>All group messages on Telegram are only encrypted between your device and Telegram’s
                    cloud, your message history is stored on Telegram’s cloud, and if you (<a
                            href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/01/30/stop-using-this-dangerous-whatsapp-setting-on-your-apple-iphone-or-google-android-phone/">unwisely</a>)
                    transfer your WhatsApp chat history to Telegram, then this is also stored on its cloud. Make you
                    sure understand that Telegram has the decryption keys to any of your data that you store on its
                    cloud...</p></blockquote>

                <p>To this argument and the many variations of it present in Telegram for iOS&#39; <a
                        href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807">App Store reviews</a>, <a

                    servers</a>, and even within <a href="https://t.me/crackheadlegit/409">public chats on Telegram,
                    itself</a>, my formal response for the record is: <em>Okay! Affirmative! Received and
                    understood!</em> I must acknowledge – given my own introduction to the service, narrated above –
                    that Telegram&#39;s brand is vaguely associated with privacy and security. I can see that the second
                    of nine duckies in the Ducky Grid on the root of telegram.org sits above the subhead “<strong>Private</strong>”
                    and a caption with the following claim: “Telegram messages are heavily encrypted and can
                    self-destruct.” (The seventh ducky&#39;s subhead is “<strong>Secure</strong>.“) Continuing on in
                    Doffman&#39;s <em>Forbes</em> article, we find an overview of several vulnerabilities found
                    throughout Telegram&#39;s native clients by Dhiraj Mishra – surely they with the most ghastly
                    typographical preferences in all of cybersecurity – on their blog, <em>Input Zero</em>.[^6] The <a
                            href="https://www.inputzero.io/2020/12/telegram-privacy-fails-again.html">specific example
                        hyperlinked</a> concerns a bug in the MacOS client that resulted in “the application leak[ing]
                    the sandbox path where [a sent audio or video message] is stored in &#39;.mp4&#39; file.” (The whole
                    of the ghastly-typewritten summary is embedded below in screenshot form.)</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/a0xgY5cJ.png" alt="Telegram Privacy - InputZero"/></p>

                <p>Just to be clear, I am being sincere when I acknowledge that these are genuinely problematic issues
                    that no doubt affected real Telegram users who depend upon its Secret Chat function. Even something
                    so benign as the file path to local media storage on my device is not something I&#39;d want
                    piggybacking my otherwise-anonymous, NDA- and/or law-breaking messages to a journalist, for
                    instance, but frankly, I don&#39;t know of any journalists who maintain public Telegram contacts,
                    anyway. Come to think of it, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve <em>ever</em> seen a Telegram username
                    publicly associated with a journalist. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of anonymous modern
                    messenger service tip lines advertised by news organizations and news people which I&#39;ve come
                    across have all linked to Signal. In this particular case, then, Mr. Elon’s advice is sound.</p>

                <p>The question I would like to surface: <strong>what if I have no use for encryption or privacy across
                    my purposes for Telegram</strong>? <em>All</em> the channels I have ever engaged with have been
                    public, and those private ones I’ve come across have either been shady crypto spam channels or shady
                    porn channels. I realize this doesn’t exactly reflect positively on Telegram’s community, but – as I
                    argued regarding Discord, long ago – why let the community or even the app’s branding, itself,
                    confine how you use it as a utility?</p>

                <h2 id="a-hearty-foundation">A Hearty Foundation</h2>

                <p>My thinking while drafting this argument kept returning to a single, simple realization: <strong>in
                    age, Telegram is just two years ahead of Discord</strong>, yet the various software distributed by
                    the two organizations for their respective services represent quite disparate opinions in design
                    terms. <a href="https://discord.com/download">Discord&#39;s desktop “application”</a> is an Electron
                    app – <a href="https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop">Telegram&#39;s</a> is virtually pure
                    C++. <a href="https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS">Telegram&#39;s iOS app</a> is
                    mostly written in Objective-C (I&#39;m to assume the 30.8% Swift code number on the repo as of this
                    writing is mostly comprised of its widgets/other recent iOS-specific integrations,) while Discord&#39;s
                    is mostly ???. That is, because Discord&#39;s software is proprietary and the source is closed, all
                    I can tell you is that it was written in React Native <a
                            href="https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-sticking-with-react-native-ccc34be0d427">as of
                        December, 2018</a>. What I <em>can</em> tell you is that the current build of <a
                            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord-talk-chat-hangout/id985746746">Discord for iOS
                        on the App Store</a> weighs in at 153.2 MB – significantly less than <a
                            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807">Telegram&#39;s</a> 185.1
                    MB. As I&#39;ve noted plenty of times this year, <strong>I am not a software developer</strong> and
                    therefore I can&#39;t promise you an app&#39;s initial payload size is actually all that relevant,
                    but I was surprised to see Telegram wasn&#39;t slimmer than Discord, given how the two apps behave
                    and my previous experiences with the platform, this year.</p>

                <p>Returning to the topic of their age… In its eight operating years, Telegram has embarked upon – and
                    <em>actually completed</em>! – a gargantuan amount of projects. <a href="https://telegra.ph/">Telegraph</a>,
                    the CMS, its <a href="http://web.telegram.org/">Web</a>, <a href="https://telegram.org/android">Android</a>,
                    and <a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-telegram-desktop-linux/">Linux</a> clients, <a
                            href="https://comments.app">embeddedable comments widgets</a>, its <a
                            href="https://themes.telegram.org/">online theme creation tool</a>, and on and on. Across
                    their various types, Telegram’s software is universally simple, frugal, robust, and easy-to-use.
                    Frankly, by contrast, Discord has done <em>nothing</em>? Though you’ll find openly-available
                    solutions to accomplish much of what you can on Telegram in terms of moderation and other
                    utilitarian concerns, like the aforementioned Craig bot, they are <em>all</em> the work of
                    third-parties. While Discord the <em>company</em> is much more <a
                            href="https://discord.com/company">transparently profiled</a> on the web than “Telegram FZ
                    LLC,” the latter’s actual work is very well documented <a
                            href="https://github.com/TelegramMessenger">across GitHub</a>.</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/DFQzGGeZ.png" alt="Telegram Desktop in Windows 11"/></p>

                <p>If you’ve stuck with me this far, perhaps it’s not too much to ask that we retreat a bit and ask
                    ourselves <strong>what we’d truly like prioritized in community chat software for 2021</strong>. I
                    really do show my age in my bias, here, as someone just old enough to have had extensive experience
                    using IRC,[^11] I think there’s a less-than-adequately discussed division happening which its
                    successors might benefit dwelling on. IRC was extremely frugal and it was easy to find a freeware or
                    FOSS IRC client for one’s given platform which was well-optimized to sit in the background of their
                    desktop operating system, completely untouched and barely acknowledged visually for days… weeks…
                    months at a time. It was easy to find oneself a member of a dozen or so IRC channels for specific
                    interests, projects, or organizations averaging a dozen or so actual updates/pots per day, each. It
                    was distinctly low pressure – many of my channel memberships functioned more like a wire service or,
                    much more contemporarily, like an RSS aggregator, than a local party line.</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/FltrCV6Z.png" alt="Telegram for iOS Sharing and Notifications"/></p>

                <p>As I see it, the ultimate shift dividing those solutions from these is the big fucking obvious one:
                    IRC was conceived in a world where computers were mostly static objects associated by their intended
                    use and physical dimensions with the referential, unmoving waypoints around which <em>we</em>
                    orbited (the kitchen counter, the desk in your study at home, parallel series of workstations within
                    the public library, etc.) The <em>entirely</em> contrasted needs of community engagement on a <em>handset</em>
                    should have – in my opinion – done much more to break apart these communal contexts than they have.
                    As prolifically and extensively as I have used Discord for iOS since before its official release,
                    even, it is hopelessly compromised by its loyalty to the PC gamer’s paradigm. My 12 Pro Max is not
                    just <em>capable</em> of keeping 100 Discord channels up-to-date in the background as I move about
                    the world – it is all too fucking <em>eager</em>, and for not a one rational explanation. Going on
                    down this vector eventually leads to an adjacent argument I’ll name but otherwise save for later: it
                    is literally <strong>over a decade</strong> past the time when we should have ceased celebrating the
                    fact that mobile computers had matched and outdone desktop computers! We have to snap the fuck out
                    of our obsession with lugging desktop computing alongside our persons and refocus entirely (once
                    again) on exploring what “mobile computing” can/should mean, going forward. Please Gourd, help us do
                    so ASAP.</p>

                <p>Unlike my heroes in most (if not all) of these tedious comparisons, I would <em>not</em> say Telegram
                    is <em>the single software manifestation of total clarity in direction</em> within the subject, or
                    anything, but in the area where it fails along with the rest of them, it has comprehensively
                    iterated, invested in trial and error, and eventually produced tools that remedy the disparate
                    gluttony. How swiftly and easily one can find one&#39;s installation full of media files, for
                    instance, after <em>any</em> time spent exploring within its mobile apps.</p>

                <p>It very well could have been mostly chance that contributed to Telegram&#39;s current lead in terms
                    of thoughtful design decisions and development investment toward <strong>mobile-first
                        optimization</strong>. Perhaps it was their comparative longstanding Hype Famine, especially in
                    the United States, these past few years. Maybe Discord hasn&#39;t built anything because they simply
                    can&#39;t hear each other over the buzzwords overflowing their name in mainstream Discourse so
                    abruptly thanks to The Big Virus.</p>

                        frameborder="0"></iframe>

                <p>Telegram&#39;s story certainly <em>stands out</em>, though the voice of its creator, Pavel Durov,
                    actually <em>telling</em> this story at length can now only be found <a
                            href="https://www.mixcloud.com/wiredUK/telegrams-pavel-durov-podcast-256">on <em>WIRED
                        UK</em>&#39;s MixCloud account</a>, in <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/episode-256">episode
                        256 of their <em>WIRED Podcast</em></a>. Telegram was experiencing the peak of its presence in
                    mainstream Western news media, who just <em>would not</em> let go of the fact that some leader of
                    some terrorist organization recommended Telegram to someone for something at some point in
                    time.[^12] Listening back, it&#39;s the nomadic “decentralized” beginnings of the organization –
                    which I had forgotten entirely – which sounded a big, resonant Parallel Alarm in my brain: for very
                    different reasons, <a href="https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music">Bandcamp also operating
                        without an office</a> (from a public library, charmingly,) at that time.</p>

                <p>“Can there only be one winner in the messaging wars?” asks David Rowan, which Pavel – in the
                    deliberate, uncomfortable-sounding tone he uses throughout the interview – answers first noting a
                    <em>real truth</em> for actual users: we tend to end up with a billion, each grouped generally by
                    types of relationships. iMessage is for your family and local friends, Facebook Messenger is for
                    your school group project, IRC and Element are for your insane, privacy-obsessed Linux friends, and
                    Telegram is for <a href="https://twitter.com/ammnontet/status/1449594872139186181">unsolicited video

                <p>[1] I still have not accepted this, by the way. I’m still back there.
                    [2] If I were to be 100% sincere, I might ask you to consider that this (hilariously brief) intent
                    was a method of coping with the great existential truths I was facing for the first time.
                    [3] I <em>definitey</em> was, though. For whatever reason, I do not remember associating the term
                    “automation” with such activities, but I just found the “receipt” for my “purchase” of <a
                            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ifttt/id660944635">IFTTT for iOS</a>… From July, 2013.
                    [4] I am currently working on a less-than-instant solution using iCloud and CopyQ’s clipboard sync
                    function.
                    [5] I would’ve said “one can never have too many backups,” but the result of such thinking is
                    ridiculously wasteful and not something I actually want to encourage.
                    [6] I&#39;m almost positive I&#39;ve heard of/been linked to this blog before, which is perhaps only
                    notable in that I managed to keep my typographic opinions to myself.
                    [7] Not that the process of doing so could be any easier on Windows.
                    [8] It’s also worth nothing that <a href="https://t.me/TelegramiOStalk/104997">word of screen
                        sharing framerate issues</a> was circulating at the time of this recording.
                    [9] Simulcast services like <a href="https://happs.tv/@DavidBlue">Happs</a> – which still exists,
                    astonishingly – offer an intriguing utility for those intending to stream regularly and wishing to
                    do so across multiple platforms. It does not, at the moment, support either Telegram or Discord.
                    [10] Speaking as someone with <a
                            href="https://dieselgoth.com/volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen-tdi-review.html">actual extensive
                        ridesharing experience</a>, notably.
                    [11] Yes, there are some fellow Open Source Folks who’ve frankly struggled to let IRC go. It was an
                    amazing protocol and will always be intertwined with the very first layed bricks of what we’d call
                    the Social Web, but my friends… I sincerely think we should all try our hands at ham radio, instead.
                    I think that would legitimately be a better use of our time than trying to implement two-factor
                    authentication for IRC in this year of our spiteful Lourde 2021.
                    [12] Disparaging Telegram for this is akin to shitting on Google because it is or was almost
                    certainly the Taliban&#39;s favorite search engine, no?</p>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Twitter Blue Bevel&#xA;&#xA;Gargantuan, ridiculously avoidable misses in Little
                Blue’s Blue.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA; source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/TwitterBlueTTS.mp3&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;Incredibly,
                the second most powerful social media company in the world has finally managed to implement a paid
                subscription model, as I’ve been begging them to do for at least 5 years, now. For three U.S. Dollars a
                month, “Twitter Blue” is now available for all United States users. Aside from a relentless, rude, two
                and a half hour-long rant at two new friends on End User, I should confess that I haven’t spoken
                adequately to peers at length about their Twitter use - understandably, busy independent artists don’t
                seem to find themsevles with the spare time to hypothesize methodically about what they might want from
                the service, going forward. From the mass of commentary on Twitter Blue I was able to gather, a
                resounding sentiment refrains: these features should be available to everyone.&#xA;&#xA;https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VSCTrzf9QN2MjyFMQ930d&#xA;&#xA;Frankly,
                after all these years, there’s not all that much to actually say about the product, itself. Thanks to
                Spaces, I happened to catch a chance to ask my favorite sage of late - Jason Scott, original creator of
                textfiles.com - for his thoughts. &#xA;&#xA;“Well, I bought it.”&#xA;“Yeah, same.”&#xA;&#xA;Twitter in
                Jorts Dock, 2021&#xA;&#xA;Then, we talked for 45 minutes about self-actualization. As I’ve recently
                honed my understanding of the significance behind my own personal extraordinary dependence/investment in
                this one service, I have also - in parallel, ya might say - refined wholly a set of expectations which I
                do not ever again expect to be usurped in any way by Twitter, Incorporated’s decisions. Believe it not,
                these thoughts of mine really do have real potential to add value to your life, especially if you’re
                still reading. The next time you find yourself wondering what Twitter might do next, try to internalize
                the utter inanity of that whole pursuit. Not one second can be concretely spent in that endeavor because
                the organization is defined singularly by its outrageous negligence. They are not villains or demons
                like Big Blue - they are through and through a village of idiots, and no manner of user action can
                possibly budge them.&#xA;&#xA;video controls&#xA; source src=&#34;https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/video/TwitterBlue.MP4&#34;&#xA;/video&#xA;&#xA;Of
                course, this new development of mine hasn’t actually managed to delivery any peace upon my person. In
                fact, because it is impossible to be constructively critical in such a situation, I am one of few I know
                who must continue to be critical, anyway, because my livelihood does not depend on the newsworthiness of
                my subject matter. I guess I should just be thankful my “must” represents so little time-sensitive
                consequence, if any, given how long it takes me to finish anything, these days. On that note, please
                look elsewhere for the bulletpoints… Come back for at least a second, though, because this Post does
                eventually circle around to a handful of poignant, original comments on the Whats.&#xA;&#xA;The peeves
                aren’t new, but I’ve found my own redundancy within The Psalms to be less and less… redundant, if that
                makes sense. This company’s software is bad and its continued prioritization of the two native mobile
                applications (neither of which it actually built) over any other clients for all user considerations is
                a spectacular tedium to follow. Its world record breaking inability to understand anything about how its
                whole shit fits into the lives of any of its users continues to astound. My peak irritation about the
                whole situation, lately, is that you fuckers continue to discuss alterations to social software,
                generally, as if they are inevitable with a sense of complicity I will not allow. I’m not going to argue
                that you’re obligated to speak up and out in a labor sense, but beseeching that you expect more from
                these organizations as a customer, a citizen, and a human being.&#xA;&#xA;For your sake, I&#39;ve spent
                the time to break Twitter Blue&#39;s offering down specifically, feature by feature, only because I have
                yet to see it done methodically in detail from the tech media sources you&#39;d normally depend on.&#xA;&#xA;Thread
                Reader - Twitter Blue for iOS&#xA;&#xA;Thread Reader&#xA;&#xA;If I’m honest, the majority of the
                discourse I’ve picked up surrounding Twitter threads in the past few years has been negative. Vaguely,
                “getting lost” is something I recall being expressed. Twitter Blue’s Thread Reader offers a “reader
                view”-like experience in three different font sizes - none of which looked particularly optimal, to my
                eye. If there’s anything to say about it, really, it’s suggest this adjustment be made more variable,
                natively, though further adjustment is allowed at the moment by using ⌘ + =, -, and 0 for those iPhone
                keyboarders among you.&#xA;&#xA;Voice Tweets in Thread Reader - Twitter for iOS&#xA;&#xA;Also, the
                appearance of non text-only posts (especially Voice Tweets, which I, alone, continue to use) in this
                view feels like a bit of an afterthought. &#xA;&#xA;Custom Navigation - Twitter Blue on iOS&#xA;&#xA;Custom
                Navigation&#xA;&#xA;Intentionally or not, the configuration of Twitter for iOS’ navigation tabs enabled
                by Twitter Blue membership is a revelation - or it would be, were it the only viable Twitter client on
                the platform. It’s perhaps the most celebratable feature included in Twitter Blue, if only because it
                suggests the Twitter team is finally paying attention to Tweetbot. (In case you weren’t aware, I spent a
                significant amount of time and words writing about just how valuable Tweetbot is, earlier this year.)
                Unfortunately for Twitter, Tweetbot’s had an incredible year. The biggest possible miss, here, was
                adamantly missed: one cannot customize away the “Home” timeline from the first nav bar position, which
                brings up another huge issue with expecting a monthly fee for an experience within Twitter’s iOS app:
                persistence. &#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467393675579871234&#xA;&#xA;In the clip of
                the Twitter feedback Space embedded above, my second point of note was that the app had not “randomly
                logged me out” in the seven days I’d then been subscribed to Twitter Blue. To be clear, this was
                referring to the experience of opening the Twitter for iOS app to the welcome screen instead of where
                one left off, which has indeed happened in the interim. The worst bit: after logging back in again, all
                one’s app preferences are reset to their respective defaults. Without a means of exporting or “backing
                up” one’s settings - like say, Better Tweetdeck has - this means that one has to methodically explore
                every single Settings menu and re-select core essentials like posting the highest quality possible
                images, for instance, all with the knowledge that such a reset could happen again at any time. Suffice
                it to say, this is not the sort of quality one expects from a premium iOS app in 2021. &#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1463658007791812608&#xA;&#xA;As
                you’ll see in the screenshot embedded above, Custom Navigation offers one a choice of up to 6 tabs from
                a total of 10, which include some Bluetooth keyboard shortcut considerations I suspect you’ll not find
                detailed from any other source. &#xA;&#xA;Bluetooth Keyboard Shortcuts Support&#xA;&#xA;To start, ⌘ + F
                will now reliably open the Explore tab and (most of the time) deliver one’s cursor directly to its
                search field. However, this only functions when Explore has been selected as one of the bottom nav tabs,
                which really misses out on an opportunity for the shortcut to be uniquely useful, in my view. Otherwise,
                ⌘ + 1-6 will open the bottom tabs you’ve chosen in order, which means - brace yourselves - that Twitter
                Blue’s Custom Navigation technically includes configurable keyboard shortcuts.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467681892468154370&#xA;&#xA;Also
                notable: when viewing the obligatory Home tab, one can navigate between their Lists with just the
                (unmodified) left and right arrow keys! ⌘ + , is now a dependable way of opening the app’s Settings
                menu, ⌘ + \ pulls up the account switcher, ⌘ + =,-,0 manipulates text size, app-wide. ⌘ + V will open
                Tweets from links in one’s clipboard from anywhere in the app - not a new trick, I don’t think, but a
                clever one. As of this writing, the public-facing document of Twitter for iOS’ Bluetooth keyboard
                shortcuts is quite inaccurate. For example, it lists ⌘ + M as the command to switch between light and
                dark mode in the app, which is actually accomplished with ⌘ + ⇧ + D.&#xA;&#xA;Undo Tweet - Twitter Blue&#xA;&#xA;Undo
                Tweet&#xA;&#xA;Perhaps unlike you, I have never had a problem understanding why “editable” Tweets will
                never exist, largely thanks to my conversation with Eugen Rochko about implementing editable posts on
                Mastodon:&#xA;&#xA; That won&#39;t happen. There&#39;s actually a good reason why they don&#39;t do
                that. It&#39;s simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share
                it, link it from other places, and then suddenly, it says &#39;Heil Hitler,&#39; or something.&#xA;&#xA;This,
                actually, is not the reason I found it easy to understand, though I hope it makes a bit of a sense. It
                was when Eugen mentioned (unquoted) Twitter&#39;s original design around SMS that I first vaguely
                understood the depth of this limitation in the core architecture of the service. As far as I understand
                it, the method in which a Tweet’s basic data is stored does not allow for revision. It can be deleted or
                obfuscated, but never substituted for or replaced.&#xA;&#xA;As I noted all those years ago. Delete &amp;
                Re-Draft - the answer Mastodon integrated natively and third-party social clients have featured for
                years - makes a lot more sense than straight up &#34;editable Tweets&#34; or the chosen answer at the
                top of Twitter Blue&#39;s feature list, &#34;Undo Tweet.&#34; &#xA;&#xA;Here&#39;s the full text from
                its subpage in Twitter&#39;s documentation:&#xA;&#xA; Undo Tweet gives you the option to retract a Tweet
                after you send it, but before it’s visible to others on Twitter. It’s not an edit button, but a chance
                to preview and revise your Tweet before it’s posted for the world to see. Once the Undo period is over,
                the Tweet is viewable to your followers and you can either leave it or delete it, like you normally
                would on Twitter. &#xA; - Tapping Undo sends you back to the Tweet composer where you can make changes
                before posting the Tweet, or deciding not to post at all. You can also select Send now to skip the Undo
                Tweet option and post your tweet immediately.&#xA; - You can turn Undo Tweet settings on for all or some
                of the different types of Tweets including Original Tweets, Quote Tweets, threads, and replies. &#xA; -
                When active, Undo Tweet displays a countdown of the time left until your default 30-second Tweet Undo
                period expires, and your Tweet appears on Twitter. Shorten or lengthen the expiration window to 5, 10,
                20 or 60 seconds under the Twitter Blue feature settings menu.&#xA; - If you turn off Undo Tweet, you
                won’t see the Undo Tweet prompt.&#xA; - Read more about how to adjust the settings of your Undo Tweet
                feature.&#xA;&#xA;By default, Undo Tweet is turned on for every single post of any kind at 20 seconds&#39;
                notice. This was my very first change to the default settings (other than the highlight color and app
                icon): I turned it off for Original Tweets, Replies, and Threads. This makes it tolerable, but still
                useless, and honestly, I can think of only one instance in which I used it for its intended purpose.&#xA;&#xA;Pinned
                DMs - Twitter Blue on iOS&#xA;&#xA;Longer Videos &amp; Pinned Conversations&#xA;&#xA;The only straight
                up “we’ll let you take up a bit more bandwidth since you’re paying us” feature addition included with
                Twitter Blue is its elongation of the time limit for posted videos from two to ten minutes. One of very
                few observations about Twitter Blue I could find from “regular” Twitter Users comes from r/Twitter
                (which is uh…. a mess:)&#xA;&#xA; the only reason i got it is because it allows 10 minutes of videos you
                can post and since I make content I no longer have to be restrained to the 2:20 video time on the &#34;regular&#34;
                Twitter.&#xA;-u/jdb825&#xA;&#xA;I personally feel this post wholeheartedly - especially since I’ve
                basically committed to single-take video content, personally, yet have been regularly sharing screencaps
                on my account. An anecdote I have not seen mentioned: for videos uploaded directly to Twitter’s “Media
                Studio” (a feature to which I have access because of my peak Periscope fame, years ago,) the two-minute
                limit still applies. Yet another beautifully absurd product oversight.&#xA;&#xA;From the screenshot
                embedded above, it’s quite obvious that I no longer use Twitter’s Direct Messages, but there was a time,
                many years ago, when I would have personally appreciated “Pinned Conversations” very much.&#xA;&#xA;Ad-Free
                Articles in Safari - Twitter Blue&#xA;&#xA;Ad-Free Articles&#xA;&#xA;As much as I want to unabashedly
                celebrate the investment Twitter, Inc. is inexplicably now demonstrating in Lists - a feature I’ve
                tirelessly advocated for out of perceived obscurity - with Twitter Blue, there’s at least one example
                which they’ve managed to fuck up such investment. The official list of publishers participating in
                Twitter Blue’s “Ad-Free Articles” rehash of Scroll is exclusively documented in the from of
                @TwitterBlue’s singular Twitter List, which makes it conveniently quite difficult to share. Aside from
                that anecdote, I have another which is both mostly personal and yet inexcludable. &#xA;&#xA;The day
                Twitter acquired Scroll, I had the bizarre, completely unexpected opportunity to ask Tony Haile -
                Scroll’s founder, who also played a substantial role in creating the Ad-Tech Hell it was founded to
                counter in creating Chartbeat, some years ago - a question. I’d been listening to a Twitter Space hosted
                by Chris Messina and Brian McCullough for TechMeme featuring Haile while I’d been showering. Somehow,
                the two ran out of questions to ask Tony, so they turned to the audience. I requested to speak and Chris
                - who’d done so a few times before - let me in almost immediately.&#xA;&#xA;Nude and still very wet,
                standing in my bathroom, I suddenly found myself on a call, essentially, with certainly the most
                interesting media industry figure of the moment. Chris, who knew me well enough already as a regular in
                his Spaces to know my speech often includes long pauses, said something like “quickly.” I began by
                bringing back a topic from an hour before, at least, and noted that Twitter’s “Tips” feature was no more
                than a list of hyperlinks as it stood (it basically still is,) before (more or less verbatim:)&#xA;&#xA;“I
                just got out of the shower but uh… I forgot about Tony Haile. (yes, he was listening directly to the
                Space and I did say that) …but I would ask him to narrate how exactly he got from Chartbeat to Scroll to
                Twitter.” Yes, I spoke of him in the third person even though I could all but hear him breathing. I then
                retired from my speaking role, but - from what I could tell, passively listening as I finished getting
                ready for some time-sensitive engagement - my question basically sustained the rest of the interview.
                &#xA;&#xA;This experience, alone, wouldn’t necessarily be worth mentioning, but after discovering The
                Kansas City Star - one of the oldest, most established local mastheads to my home state (Missouri,) to
                which I maintain a subscription - among the aforelinked List list of participating publishers in Twitter
                Blue’s Ad-Free Articles program, I reached out to the one Star reporter I know, asking simply if she’d
                heard anything whatsoever about the program from editors or just ambiently in the newsroom. She had not.
                &#xA;&#xA;For an explanation, I dug just a bit further and found out the Stars’ corporate owner,
                McClatchy, had in fact “tested” a “partnership” with Scroll before, and appeared to have opted its whole
                handful of local American news institutions - including the Star - in again, en masse, to its new,
                Twitter-owned form. &#xA;&#xA;Before I go on, I should note that one can indeed utilize Ad-Free
                articles’ benefit within your preferred web browser, but the process is very specific. On iOS, you’ll
                need to open an Ad-Free Article in the Twitter app first (marked with blue text) and then tap the Safari
                icon in the bottom right to open your default browser. You’ll know you’ve authenticated correctly when
                you see one of these two motherfuckers (depending on your system’s current light/dark theme setting) in
                the bottom right of your browser window:&#xA;&#xA;Twitter Blue Tabs&#xA;&#xA;For thoroughness’ sake,
                here’s what the official help document has to say:&#xA;&#xA; As long as you stay logged in to Twitter,
                and use the same browser each time, you should get ad-free reading when you subsequently visit that same
                Twitter Blue site.&#xA;&#xA;Have a peak at The Kansas City Star’s Wikipedia page and you’ll note that
                it’s over 150 years old, once claimed Ernest Hemingway on its masthead, has been awarded eight Pulitzer
                Prizes, and that it depends on a combination of advertising dollars and possibly in duress subscription
                revenue to stay afloat. This in mind, note the screenshot I’ve embedded below, comparing how a Twitter
                Blue-participating Star article appears within a desktop browser - without Twitter Blue vs Twitter Blue.&#xA;&#xA;Kansas
                City Star Twitter Blue Comparison&#xA;&#xA;Captures of each respective webpage demonstrate that Twitter
                Blue exempts a reader from about half of the content weight of the non-Blue-authenticated render. Old
                school banner ads account for a portion of the missing content, but at least three elements for
                converting visiting readers to paying subscribers make up for most of it, I’d wager. None of what’s gone
                is content anyone on Earth wants to see, mind you, but frankly, it’s disrespectful of the paper’s
                classically villainous, recently bankrupt corporate overloard to opt it in with a program fundamentally
                designed to intentionally forgo advertising engagement. &#xA;&#xA;See Your Impact - Twitter Blue&#xA;&#xA;Tony
                Haile, if you’re reading this, you can exhale now. Yes, the theory behind Scroll, and now “Ad-Free
                Articles” in Twitter Blue, suggests that the fifteen cents I’ve earned the Star so far (the graphic
                above can be found in the “See Your Impact” selection within one’s Twitter Settings) will be paid
                directly to… Whom, exactly?&#xA;&#xA;The answer offered by Twitter, Inc. to the question of “How does my
                ad-free reading support journalism?” (asked of themselves:)&#xA;&#xA; Each month, we pay publishers
                within the Twitter Blue Publishers Network based on the content you and other Twitter Blue subscribers
                read ad-free through Twitter Blue. Our model is designed to help publishers continue to fund the
                journalism you love to read.&#xA;&#xA;Publishers. I suspect that means cash-desperate McClatchy and not
                The Kansas City Star. All to be done at the moment, at least, is to ask ourselves how much of that cash
                will ever be seen by the paper. &#xA;&#xA;Bookmark Folders - Twitter Blue&#xA;&#xA;Bookmark Folders&#xA;&#xA;Bookmarks
                and Bookmark Folders represent yet further evidence that someone at Twitter, Inc. actually uses Twitter
                (or perhaps has a friend or family member.) Technically, they also represent one of few core functions
                exclusive to Twitter’s own clients. (Consider: Tweetbot even supports polls, now.) However, like the
                Thread Reader and “Custom Themes,” Bookmark Folders, too, feel like an afterthought shoved in the bundle
                an hour before a deadline. Specifically, their color-coded icons look like placeholders for custom
                images… which aren’t supported, and they represent 0 additional function as curatorial/archival tools
                (no exporting/aggregating/or sorting, even) beyond simply nesting bookmarks into… folders.&#xA;&#xA;Themes
                &amp; Icons - Twitter Blue for iOS&#xA;&#xA;Icons &amp; “Themes”&#xA;&#xA;Even greater heights of
                half-assery have been achieved by what Twitter describes as “exclusive app icons and colorful themes.”
                Here, I must finally give in and compare Twitter Blue with Tweetbot directly. &#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467422017527951366&#xA;&#xA;Absolutely
                zero effort has been expended thus far in recharacterizing what Web Twitter still calls “Colors” as
                “Themes,” and the only exclusivity in the icon options is that some are seasonal, or otherwise
                time-limited, for what possible purpose I cannot conceive. This from a company of more than 5000
                full-time employees. &#xA;&#xA;In contrast, from a full-time team of two - both of whom suffered through
                bad COVID infections, this year - Tweetbot now includes an even further broadened spectrum of app-wide
                themes and 19 app icons in total, including, yes, at least two very cute, limited-time seasonal options.

                Powerusers&#xA;&#xA;The episode of End User embedded above is one of the only podcast episodes I’ve ever
                made which I actually find too painful to listen back to, but I still think it’s valuable. There’s a
                specific bit of the conversation between @alisonbuki and I in which the term “Poweruser” is actually
                thrown around regarding my own use of Twitter Lists, Tweetbot, and a few other Hax to consume content
                deliberately. I think I failed somewhere in my portrayal of this curation and miscommunicated the nature
                of what I was trying to get at by “making use of the tools available to you.” Regarding the actual
                manhours involved in the configuration I was trying to evangelize, I think I’ve spent more time trying
                to describe the effort than I have actually configuring my own content intake. &#xA;&#xA;Long before I
                was follow-limited in 2017, I lived entirely in my Twitter Listshttps://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists), the
                largest of which I built up “organically” over time, by adding appropriate accounts one by one as I came
                across them. Thanks to Tweetbot, my equivalent of the native apps’s Home timeline is a private List of
                ~200 accounts whose users represent the actual entirety of my adult social life, past to present. Then,
                there’s The New, which - I must admit - has grown beyond its original scope and sortof become my follow
                list, with enough exceptions that I consider it worthwhile to keep public. Then, there’s the newest - my
                Meta-Media List - and the very oldest: my dear, weathered Rolodex of Automotive Twitter. I keep Tweetbot
                in my dock and the native app on my device just for notifications, Spaces, and now Communities. That’s
                it! Yet, using this configuration, I never see content that seriously disturbs, shames, triggers, or
                otherwise upsets me beyond reason or expectation, but am regularly exposed to a relatively diverse
                palette of perspectives, and just generally find my consumption/engagement time on the service
                meaningfully spent. &#xA;&#xA;The particular amalgamation of truly half-assed user experience features
                offered in Twitter Blue lend toward a narrative about this company which we collectively have continued
                to fall for literally dozens of times - often in immediate succession - throughout the fewer years of
                its history: that it finally has a morsel of what might just become a cohesive vision. Clearly, I am as
                susceptible to this as anyone considering how quickly I jumped to celebrating the fact that finally,
                Twitter had seen the humongous value to be imparted to its userbase by simply adding basic configurables
                like custom navigation and especially refining the essential curatorial tool that is Lists. &#xA;&#xA;Were
                I still a person who wastes my energy speculating on the real happenings within Twitter, Inc, though, an
                entirely different, much more realistic sounding theory arises after the analysis we’ve trudged through
                together in this post: every single item on Twitter Blue’s feature list represents the absolute bare
                minimum resource investment possible. If I had any money, I’d go on to bet that Shihab Mehboob could
                have built from scratch every single developmental “addition” to the iOS app Twitter Blue includes in a
                matter of hours, though from experience, I seriously doubt he’d ever allow such lackluster work to reach
                even beta tester’s fingers. As far as Ad-Free Articles go, Twitter hasn’t even bothered to swap out all
                the Scroll branding. The fact that I had to surface the concept of Delete and Re-Draft to Twitter
                Employee brains for what all appearances indicate was the first time in that “FeedbackFriday” Twitter
                Space represents a truly sickening lack of effort. No, the story that aligns much more succinctly in the
                grander context is that Twitter Blue just happened to be the first disjointed, scatterbrained
                subscription service pitch to finally fall out the rectum of this miraculously bunk organization, but
                all you motherfuckers can talk about is Japple Notes Dorsey walking out, and what it could mean.&#xA;&#xA;Since
                I have now actually been personally and explicitly invited to share feedback regarding Twitter Blue, I
                suppose I’ll make some effort to send them this hyperlink. In that vein, I think I’ll end with some
                advice addressed directly to Twitter, Incorporated:&#xA;&#xA;Hey Twitter! If you ever find yourself
                genuinely interested in selling a subscription product long term, as a mutual value exchange with your
                users, make all of Twitter Blue’s features available to all users, and ditch Scroll entirely. Instead of
                placing the bet on local newspapers like The Kansas City Star, it should be on you to take the financial
                risk yourself, and offer, simply, a completely ad-free Twitter experience. That might just be worth
                $2.99 a month.&#xA;&#xA;1] Despite the fact that Tweeting via SMS has [since been disabled.&#xA;[2] I
                was just… rude. Very rude. “Necessary” is not a term I’d apply to this rudeness, but… Just give me this
                once, please.&#xA;[3] In the process of trying to capture a good image of this thing, I noticed that all
                the assets are still being loaded from static.scroll.com. Nice.&#xA;4] See for yourself via [this thread
                on my Telegram channel.&#xA;[5] An obligatory note that I am of the most privileged sort of human there
                ever has been, or that one can be.&#xA;&#xA;a href=&#34;https://remark.as/p/bilge.world/twitter-blue&#34;Discuss.../a&#xA;&#xA;#software

                <p>Incredibly, the second most powerful social media company in the world has finally managed to
                    implement a paid subscription model, as I’ve been begging them to do for <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/696094018862718976">at least 5 years</a>, now. For
                    three U.S. Dollars a month, “<a

                        available</a> for all United States users. Aside from <a href="https://apple.co/3wVZs3v">a
                        relentless, rude, two and a half hour-long rant</a> at two new friends on <em>End User</em>, I
                    should confess that I haven’t spoken adequately to peers at length about their Twitter use –
                    understandably, busy independent artists don’t seem to find themsevles with the spare time to
                    hypothesize methodically about what they might want from the service, going forward. From the mass
                    of commentary on Twitter Blue I <em>was</em> able to gather, a resounding sentiment refrains: <em>these
                        features should be available to everyone</em>.</p>

                </p>

                <p>Frankly, after all these years, there’s not all that much to actually say about the product, itself.
                    Thanks to Spaces, I happened to catch a chance to ask my favorite sage of late – Jason Scott,
                    original creator of textfiles.com – for his thoughts.</p>

                <p>“Well, I bought it.”
                    “Yeah, same.”</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/zp5uCNwa.png" alt="Twitter in Jorts Dock, 2021"/></p>

                <p>Then, we talked for 45 minutes about self-actualization. As I’ve recently honed my understanding of
                    the significance behind my own personal extraordinary dependence/investment in this one service, I
                    have also – in parallel, ya might say – refined wholly a set of expectations which I do not ever
                    again expect to be usurped in any way by Twitter, Incorporated’s decisions. Believe it not, these
                    thoughts of mine really <em>do</em> have real potential to add value to your life, especially if
                    you’re still reading. The next time you find yourself wondering what Twitter might do next, try to
                    internalize the utter inanity of that whole pursuit. Not one second can be concretely spent in that
                    endeavor because the organization is defined singularly by its outrageous negligence. They are not
                    villains or demons like <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bigblue">Big Blue</a> – they are
                    through and through a village of idiots, and no manner of user action can possibly budge them.</p>

                </video>

                <p>Of course, this new development of mine hasn’t actually managed to delivery any peace upon my person.
                    In fact, because it is impossible to be <em>constructively</em> critical in such a situation, I am
                    one of few I know who must continue to be critical, anyway, because my livelihood does not depend on
                    the newsworthiness of my subject matter. I guess I should just be thankful my “must” represents so
                    little time-sensitive consequence, if any, given how long it takes me to finish anything, these
                    days. On that note, please <a
                            href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free">look
                        elsewhere</a> for the bulletpoints… Come back for at least a second, though, because this Post
                    <em>does</em> eventually circle around to a handful of poignant, original comments on the
                    <del>Whats</del>
                    .
                </p>

                <p>The peeves aren’t new, but I’ve found my own redundancy within <em>The Psalms</em> to be less and
                    less… redundant, if that makes sense. This company’s software is bad and its continued
                    prioritization of the two native mobile applications (neither of which it actually built) over any
                    other clients for <em>all</em> user considerations is a spectacular tedium to follow. Its world
                    record breaking inability to understand anything about how its <em>whole shit</em> fits into the
                    lives of <em>any</em> of its users continues to astound. My peak irritation about the whole
                    situation, lately, is that <em>you fuckers</em> continue to discuss alterations to social software,
                    generally, as if they are <em>inevitable</em> with a sense of complicity I will <em>not</em> allow.
                    I’m not going to argue that you’re <em>obligated</em> to speak up and out in a labor sense, but
                    beseeching that you <strong>expect more</strong> from these organizations as a customer, a citizen,
                    and a human being.</p>

                <p>For your sake, I&#39;ve spent the time to break Twitter Blue&#39;s offering down specifically,
                    feature by feature, only because I have yet to see it done methodically in detail from the tech
                    media sources you&#39;d normally depend on.</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/SAYPlThr.png" alt="Thread Reader - Twitter Blue for iOS"/></p>

                <h2 id="thread-reader">Thread Reader</h2>

                <p>If I’m honest, the majority of the discourse I’ve picked up surrounding Twitter threads in the past
                    few years has been negative. Vaguely, “getting lost” is something I recall being expressed. Twitter
                    Blue’s Thread Reader offers a “reader view”-like experience in three different font sizes – none of
                    which looked particularly optimal, to my eye. If there’s anything to say about it, really, it’s
                    suggest this adjustment be made more variable, natively, though further adjustment is allowed at the
                    moment by using <code>⌘ + =, -, and 0</code> for those iPhone keyboarders among you.</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/1ia6xNyv.png" alt="Voice Tweets in Thread Reader - Twitter for iOS"/></p>

                <p>Also, the appearance of non text-only posts (especially Voice Tweets, which I, alone, continue to
                    use) in this view feels like a bit of an afterthought.</p>

                <h2 id="custom-navigation">Custom Navigation</h2>

                <p>Intentionally or not, the configuration of Twitter for iOS’ navigation tabs enabled by Twitter Blue
                    membership is a revelation – or it would be, were it the only viable Twitter client on the platform.
                    It’s perhaps the most celebratable feature included in Twitter Blue, if only because it suggests the
                    Twitter team is finally paying attention to Tweetbot. (In case you weren’t aware, I spent a
                    significant amount of time and words writing about just how valuable Tweetbot is, <a
                            href="https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review">earlier this year</a>.) Unfortunately for
                    Twitter, <a
                            href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/tweetbot-6-6-gets-support-for-creating-polls-limiting-who-can-reply-to-tweets/">Tweetbot’s
                        had an incredible year</a>. The biggest possible miss, here, was adamantly missed: one <em>cannot</em>
                    customize away the “Home” timeline from the first nav bar position, which brings up another huge
                    issue with expecting a monthly fee for an experience within Twitter’s iOS app: <em>persistence</em>.

                <p>In the clip of the Twitter feedback Space embedded above, my second point of note was that the app
                    had not “randomly logged me out” in the seven days I’d then been subscribed to Twitter Blue. To be
                    clear, this was referring to the experience of opening the Twitter for iOS app to the welcome screen
                    instead of where one left off, which has indeed happened in the interim. The worst bit: after
                    logging back in again, all one’s app preferences are reset to their respective defaults. Without a
                    means of exporting or “backing up” one’s settings – like say, <a href="https://better.tw">Better
                        Tweetdeck</a> has – this means that one has to methodically explore every single Settings menu
                    and re-select core essentials like posting the highest quality possible images, for instance, all
                    with the knowledge that such a reset could happen again at any time. Suffice it to say, this is not
                    the sort of quality one expects from a premium iOS app in 2021.</p>

                    from a total of 10, which include <a
                            href="https://github.com/ExtraKeys/keys/issues/31#issuecomment-986184090">some Bluetooth

                <p>To start, <code>⌘ + F</code> will now reliably open the Explore tab and (most of the time) deliver
                    one’s cursor directly to its search field. However, <strong>this only functions when Explore has
                        been selected as one of the bottom nav tabs</strong>, which really misses out on an opportunity
                    for the shortcut to be uniquely useful, in my view. Otherwise, <code>⌘ + 1-6</code> will open the
                    bottom tabs you’ve chosen in order, which means – brace yourselves – that Twitter Blue’s Custom
                    Navigation technically includes <em>configurable keyboard shortcuts</em>.</p>

                    the (unmodified) left and right arrow keys! <code>⌘ + ,</code> is now a dependable way of opening
                    the app’s Settings menu, <code>⌘ + \</code> pulls up the account switcher, <code>⌘ + =,-,0</code>
                    manipulates text size, app-wide. <code>⌘ + V</code> will open Tweets from links in one’s clipboard
                    from anywhere in the app – not a new trick, I don’t think, but a clever one. As of this writing, <a

                    <code>⌘ + M</code> as the command to switch between light and dark mode in the app, which is
                    actually accomplished with <code>⌘ + ⇧ + D</code>.</p>

                <h2 id="undo-tweet">Undo Tweet</h2>

                <p>Perhaps unlike you, <em>I</em> have never had a problem understanding why “editable” Tweets will
                    never exist, largely thanks to <a
                            href="https://hyp.is/znp7tEQJEeySOXvhkqI2DQ/bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview">my
                        conversation with Eugen Rochko</a> about implementing editable posts on Mastodon:</p>

                <blockquote><p>That won&#39;t happen. There&#39;s actually a good reason why they don&#39;t do that. It&#39;s
                    simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it
                    from other places, and then suddenly, it says &#39;Heil Hitler,&#39; or something.</p></blockquote>

                <p>This, actually, is <em>not</em> the reason I found it easy to understand, though I hope it makes a
                    bit of a sense. It was when Eugen mentioned (unquoted) Twitter&#39;s original design around SMS[^1]
                    that I first vaguely understood the depth of this limitation in the core architecture of the
                    service. As far as I understand it, <strong>the method in which a Tweet’s basic data is stored does
                        not allow for revision</strong>. It can be deleted or obfuscated, but never substituted for or
                    replaced.</p>

                <p>As I noted all those years ago. <strong>Delete &amp; Re-Draft</strong> – the answer Mastodon
                    integrated natively and third-party social clients have featured for years – makes <em>a lot</em>
                    more sense than straight up “editable Tweets” <em>or</em> the chosen answer at the top of Twitter
                    Blue&#39;s feature list, “<a

                    revise your Tweet before it’s posted for the world to see. Once the Undo period is over, the Tweet
                    is viewable to your followers and you can either leave it or delete it, like you normally would on

                <p>By default, Undo Tweet is turned on for every single post of any kind at 20 seconds&#39; notice. This
                    was my very first change to the default settings (<a
                            href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1459235983174639626">other than the highlight
                        color and app icon</a>): I turned it off for Original Tweets, Replies, and Threads. This makes
                    it tolerable, but still useless, and honestly, I can think of only one instance in which I used it
                    for its intended purpose.</p>

                    addition included with Twitter Blue is its elongation of the time limit for posted videos from two
                    to ten minutes. One of very few observations about Twitter Blue I could find from “regular” Twitter

                <p>I personally feel this post wholeheartedly – especially since I’ve basically committed to single-take
                    video content, personally, yet have been regularly sharing screencaps on my account. An anecdote I
                    have not seen mentioned: for videos uploaded directly to Twitter’s “Media Studio” (a feature to
                    which I have access because of my peak Periscope fame, years ago,) the two-minute limit still
                    applies. Yet another beautifully absurd product oversight.</p>

                <p>From the screenshot embedded above, it’s quite obvious that I no longer use Twitter’s Direct
                    Messages, but there was a time, many years ago, when I would have personally appreciated “<strong>Pinned
                        Conversations</strong>” very much.</p>

                <h2 id="ad-free-articles">Ad-Free Articles</h2>

                <p>As much as I want to unabashedly celebrate the investment Twitter, Inc. is inexplicably now
                    demonstrating in Lists – a feature I’ve <a href="https://bilge.world/twitter-lists">tirelessly
                        advocated for</a> out of perceived obscurity – with Twitter Blue, there’s at least one example
                    which they’ve managed to fuck up such investment. The official list of publishers participating in
                    Twitter Blue’s “Ad-Free Articles” rehash of Scroll is exclusively documented in the from of <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1448014243245150209">@TwitterBlue’s singular Twitter
                        List</a>, which makes it conveniently quite difficult to share. Aside from that anecdote, I have
                    another which is both mostly personal and yet inexcludable.</p>

                <p>The day <a
                        href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711233/scroll-shutting-down-twitter-blue-standalone-subscription-ad-free-article-service">Twitter
                    acquired Scroll</a>, I had the bizarre, completely unexpected opportunity to ask Tony Haile –
                    Scroll’s founder, who also played a substantial role in creating the Ad-Tech Hell it was founded to
                    counter in creating Chartbeat, some years ago – <em>a question</em>. I’d been listening to a Twitter
                    Space hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina">Chris Messina</a> and <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/brianmcc">Brian McCullough</a> for <em>TechMeme</em> featuring
                    Haile while I’d been showering. Somehow, the two ran out of questions to ask Tony, so they turned to
                    the audience. I requested to speak and Chris – who’d done so a few times before – let me in almost
                    immediately.</p>

                <p>Nude and still very wet, standing in my bathroom, I suddenly found myself on a call, essentially,
                    with certainly the most interesting media industry figure of the moment. Chris, who knew me well
                    enough already as a regular in his Spaces to know my speech often includes long pauses, said
                    something like “quickly.” I began by bringing back a topic from an hour before, at least, and noted
                    that Twitter’s “Tips” feature was no more than a list of hyperlinks as it stood (it basically still
                    is,) before (more or less verbatim:)</p>

                <p>“I just got out of the shower but uh… I forgot about Tony Haile. (yes, he was listening directly to
                    the Space and I did say that) …but I would ask him to narrate how exactly he got from Chartbeat to
                    Scroll to Twitter.” Yes, I spoke of him in the third person even though I could all but hear him
                    breathing. I then retired from my speaking role, but – from what I could tell, passively listening
                    as I finished getting ready for some time-sensitive engagement – my question basically sustained the
                    rest of the interview.</p>

                <p>This experience, alone, wouldn’t necessarily be worth mentioning, but after discovering <em>The
                    Kansas City Star</em> – one of the oldest, most established local mastheads to my home state
                    (Missouri,) to which I maintain a subscription – among the aforelinked List list of participating
                    publishers in Twitter Blue’s Ad-Free Articles program, I reached out to the one <em>Star</em>
                    reporter I know, asking simply if she’d heard anything whatsoever about the program from editors or
                    just ambiently in the newsroom. She had not.</p>

                <p>For an explanation, I dug just a bit further and found out the <em>Stars</em>’ corporate owner,
                    McClatchy, had in fact <a
                            href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/12/scroll-the-ad-free-news-startup-will-experiment-with-bundled-subscriptions-at-eight-mcclatchy-sites/">“tested”
                        a “partnership” with Scroll before</a>, and appeared to have opted its whole handful of local
                    American news institutions – including the <em>Star</em> – in again, en masse, to its new,
                    Twitter-owned form.</p>

                <p>Before I go on, I should note that one can indeed utilize Ad-Free articles’ benefit within your
                    preferred web browser, but the process is very specific. On iOS, you’ll need to open an Ad-Free
                    Article in the Twitter app first (marked with blue text) and then tap the Safari icon in the bottom
                    right to open your default browser. You’ll know you’ve authenticated correctly when you see one of
                    these two motherfuckers[^3] (depending on your system’s current light/dark theme setting) in the
                    bottom right of your browser window:</p>

                    embedded below, comparing how a Twitter Blue-participating <em>Star</em> article appears within a

                <p>Captures of each respective webpage demonstrate that Twitter Blue exempts a reader from about half of
                    the content weight of the non-Blue-authenticated render[^4]. Old school banner ads account for a
                    portion of the missing content, but at least three elements for converting visiting readers to
                    paying subscribers make up for most of it, I’d wager. None of what’s gone is content anyone on Earth
                    <em>wants</em> to see, mind you, but frankly, it’s disrespectful of the paper’s classically
                    villainous, <a

                <p><em>Publishers</em>. I suspect that means cash-desperate McClatchy and <em>not</em> <em>The Kansas

                <h2 id="bookmark-folders">Bookmark Folders</h2>

                <p>Bookmarks and <strong>Bookmark Folders</strong> represent yet further evidence that someone at
                    Twitter, Inc. <em>actually uses Twitter</em> (or perhaps has a friend or family member.)
                    Technically, they also represent one of few core functions exclusive to Twitter’s own clients.
                    (Consider: Tweetbot even supports polls, now.) However, like the Thread Reader and “Custom Themes,”
                    Bookmark Folders, too, feel like an afterthought shoved in the bundle an hour before a deadline.
                    Specifically, their color-coded icons look like placeholders for custom images… which aren’t
                    supported, and they represent 0 additional function as curatorial/archival tools (no
                    exporting/aggregating/or sorting, even) beyond simply nesting bookmarks into… folders.</p>

                <p>Absolutely zero effort has been expended thus far in recharacterizing what Web Twitter still calls
                    “Colors” as “Themes,” and the only <em>exclusivity</em> in the icon options is that some are
                    seasonal, or otherwise time-limited, for what possible purpose I cannot conceive. This from a
                    company of more than 5000 full-time employees.</p>

                <p>In contrast, from a full-time team of two – both of whom suffered through bad COVID infections, this
                    year – Tweetbot now includes an even further broadened spectrum of app-wide themes and 19 app icons
                    in total, including, yes, at least two very cute, limited-time seasonal options.</p>

                </h2>

                <p>The episode of <em>End User</em> embedded above is one of the only podcast episodes I’ve ever made
                    which I actually find <em>too painful</em> to listen back to[^2], but I still think it’s valuable.
                    There’s a specific bit of the conversation between <a href="https://twitter.com/alisonbuki">@alisonbuki</a>
                    and I in which the term “Poweruser” is actually thrown around regarding my own use of Twitter Lists,
                    Tweetbot, and a few other <em>Hax</em> to consume content <em>deliberately</em>. I think I failed
                    somewhere in my portrayal of this curation and miscommunicated the nature of what I was trying to
                    get at by “making use of the tools available to you.” Regarding the actual manhours involved in the
                    configuration I was trying to evangelize, I think I’ve spent more time trying to describe the effort
                    than I have actually configuring my own content intake.</p>

                <p>Long before I was <a href="https://bit.ly/dbfollow">follow-limited</a> in 2017, I lived entirely in
                    my [Twitter Lists]()<a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists)">https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists)</a>,
                    the largest of which I built up “organically” over time, by adding appropriate accounts one by one
                    as I came across them. Thanks to Tweetbot, my equivalent of the native apps’s Home timeline is a
                    private List of ~200 accounts whose users represent the actual entirety of my adult social life,
                    past to present. Then, there’s <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists/the-new">The New</a>,
                    which – I must admit – has grown beyond its original scope and sortof become my follow list, with
                    enough exceptions that I consider it worthwhile to keep public. Then, there’s the newest – <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/768458273141907456">my Meta-Media List</a> – and the very
                    oldest: my dear, weathered <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/43457439">Rolodex of Automotive
                        Twitter</a>. I keep Tweetbot in my dock and the native app on my device just for notifications,
                    Spaces, and now Communities. That’s it! Yet, using this configuration, I <em>never</em> see content
                    that seriously disturbs, shames, triggers, or otherwise upsets me beyond reason or expectation[^5],
                    but am regularly exposed to a relatively diverse palette of perspectives, and just generally find my
                    consumption/engagement time on the service meaningfully spent.</p>

                <p>The particular amalgamation of truly half-assed user experience features offered in Twitter Blue lend
                    toward a narrative about this company which we collectively have continued to fall for literally
                    <em>dozens</em> of times – often in immediate succession – throughout the fewer years of its
                    history: that it <em>finally</em> has a morsel of what <em>might just become</em> a cohesive vision.
                    Clearly, I am as susceptible to this as anyone considering how quickly I jumped to celebrating the
                    fact that <em>finally</em>, Twitter had seen the humongous value to be imparted to its userbase by
                    simply adding basic configurables like custom navigation and especially refining the essential
                    curatorial tool that is Lists.</p>

                <p>Were I still a person who wastes my energy speculating on the real happenings within Twitter, Inc,
                    though, an entirely different, much more realistic sounding theory arises after the analysis we’ve
                    trudged through together in this post: every single item on Twitter Blue’s feature list represents
                    the absolute bare minimum resource investment possible. If I had any money, I’d go on to bet that <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/jpeguin">Shihab Mehboob</a> could have built from scratch every
                    single developmental “addition” to the iOS app Twitter Blue includes in a matter of hours, though
                    from experience, I seriously doubt he’d ever allow such lackluster work to reach even beta tester’s
                    fingers. As far as Ad-Free Articles go, Twitter hasn’t even bothered to swap out all the Scroll
                    branding. The fact that <em>I</em> had to surface the concept of Delete and Re-Draft to Twitter
                    Employee brains for what all appearances indicate was the first time in that “FeedbackFriday”
                    Twitter Space represents a truly sickening lack of effort. No, the story that aligns much more
                    succinctly in the grander context is that Twitter Blue just happened to be the first disjointed,
                    scatterbrained subscription service pitch to finally fall out the rectum of this miraculously bunk
                    organization, but all you motherfuckers can talk about is Japple Notes Dorsey walking out, and <em>what
                        it could mean</em>.</p>

                <p>Since I have now actually been personally and explicitly invited to share feedback regarding Twitter
                    Blue, I suppose I’ll make some effort to send them this hyperlink. In that vein, I think I’ll end
                    with some advice addressed directly to Twitter, Incorporated:</p>

                <p>Hey Twitter! If you ever find yourself genuinely interested in selling a subscription product long
                    term, as a mutual value exchange with your users, make all of Twitter Blue’s features available to
                    all users, and ditch Scroll entirely. Instead of placing the bet on local newspapers like <em>The
                        Kansas City Star</em>, it should be on <em>you</em> to <strong>take the financial risk yourself,
                        and offer, simply, a completely ad-free Twitter experience</strong>. That might just be worth
                    $2.99 a month.</p>

                <p>[1] Despite the fact that Tweeting via SMS has <a
                        href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20849865/twitter-disables-sms-text-message-tweeting-jack-dorsey-ceo-hack">since

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[lol Artifact&#xA;&#xA;A rushed request for pause &amp; reflection on why we use
                social media.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA; source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/StratSocial.m4a&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;I
                have not been able to follow any more accounts on Twitter - from @NeoYokel, my primary, eldest account -
                for several years because of a limit implemented at some point by Twitter and documented in this help
                document. Considering the breadth of the mechanic&#39;s significance for other users, I have often been
                compelled to explain this to new followers. Recently, it occurred to me that a handy, brief explainer
                page might streamline this process, so I created &#34;Why I Didn&#39;t Follow You Back&#34; - in both
                GitHub Gist and Medium post form. Other than a lack of reciprocity in engagement which I can only
                speculate to occur in the minds of the opposite parties involved in this dynamic, this limitation does
                not detract from my Twitter life, as I exclusively consume content in Twitter Lists (which I have spoken
                about extensively, elsewhere.)&#xA;&#xA;https://open.spotify.com/episode/4veXFMCFGgz0Fjnx7UBkpl&#xA;&#xA;A
                big theme in my 20s has been coming (slowly) to terms with the fact that I built my entire adult social
                life around a single, centralized social media Web Site. I mentioned this in my Tweetbot 6 review,
                recently, but - as I also strive to be a more sincere person and spend more time adding value to others’
                lives - I’ve concluded that it is the time now to speak as openly and vulnerably as I can about my
                “Social Media Methodology.” Most of the resulting insights will not be new information, but I continue
                to encounter greater and greater confusion in the face of my well-meaning behavior online and I have
                decided to stop disregarding it.&#xA;&#xA;This is not an essay about how to “optimize” your social media
                use. It is - at least in part - a sort of manifesto against the very idea of designed online behavior
                beyond simply being considerate in a sense that predates even the spoken word. I, myself, have occupied
                a position well on the chaotic side of the spectrum. You could say I have been mostly chaotic neutral
                throughout my 12 years on Twitter thus far, and am actively working toward (and advocating for) chaotic
                good. Perhaps inevitably, I&#39;m going to wade into some experiences with a few specific social media
                phenomena which I am particularly reacting to, here.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/753114804617932801&#xA;&#xA;Assumptions
                at bat&#xA;&#xA;For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of \[insert vague overused
                marketing jargon noun\] will ever result in a substantial accumulation of money/&#34;influence&#34;
                (which seems to be the diluted zag of &#34;POWER&#34; of the moment.) Those interested in learning about
                &#34;marketing&#34; should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to start with
                Twitter - this I can say with certainty.&#xA;&#xA;Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks
                with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user&#39;s
                choices/methodology to produce results which we have, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study
                over time, it was not created as a game to be won. Perhaps more importantly, the &#34;prize&#34; of
                &#34;winning&#34; in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, &#34;influence,&#34;
                relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the
                very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.&#xA;&#xA;If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny,
                the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with both strangers
                and friends in a manner which generally adds value to the lives of all involved.&#xA;&#xA;3 is not only
                possible - it is easily reproducible. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I
                believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples.&#xA;&#xA;Though
                I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means
                of interacting positively on social media.&#xA;&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A-Gzn0wu3Q&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;ve
                come to the conclusion fairly recently that I need to become brutally frank about the discrepancies I&#39;ve
                observed between others&#39; accounts of their social media use and my own as soon as possible. The
                great, ambient grousing summoned throughout The Plague from even the first picogeneration to be born
                directly into The Social Web really challenged my assumptions about its actual purpose in the day-to-day
                lives of those in the center of the adoption curve. You mean to tell me you&#39;ve been spending all
                that societally-alarming time on your phone... On social media services... and you haven&#39;t made a
                single international friend? Or happened across a single niche community surrounding some bizarre
                practice or knowledge you&#39;d long thought you were entirely alone in? What exactly have you being
                doing with all that tapping since your toddlerhood, then? I had absolutely no clue how utterly
                ineffective the vast majority of n̳o̳r̳m̳i̳e̳s̳ still are at using social media for its general purpose
                in the most abstract sense: &#34;human connection.&#34;&#xA;&#xA;The essential realization toward which
                (I desperately hope) the largesse of America is being carried by conversations around An Ugly Truth, as
                well as countless lower-profile essays, features, academic papers, and general shit shooting is that the
                responsibility for this ignorance rests solely on the platforms who systematically reformed the controls
                originally handed over by default to early adopters like me. I would love (for both selfish and very
                humanitarian reasons) to be able to proclaim some precious, one-of-a-kind genius as the sole
                differentiator between my complete confidence in my ability to design and maintain social software
                configurations that have kept my online consumption entirely free of unwanted encounters and the amount
                of regular involuntary bullshit I hear described in the day-to-day online existence of everyone around
                me. The truth, I suspect, involves my being of the most privileged category of human in Western
                civilization combined with the group of high school friends who adopted and socialized me. (A story for
                another permalink, certainly, if not my equivalent of Trick Mirror.)&#xA;&#xA;\~\~More importantly,
                perhaps, I don&#39;t think I can recall a single instance of sincere malice from within myself toward
                anyone who&#39;d actually converse with me. On the occasions I have been all huffy and confrontational,
                I do not remember a single example in which I was unwittingly ejected from a conversation left feeling
                unsatisfied.\~\~&#xA;&#xA;Over the past few months, I&#39;ve started a few Posts for this blog regarding
                Twitter, its properties, and its recent feature addition frenzy which I&#39;ll probably never finish. I
                finished the first and narrowest one - the aforelinked Tweetbot 6 review - but the (debatably) most
                important one - highlighting how irresponsibly and distastefully Twitter butchered Periscope and built
                Spaces atop its technology - would make less and less sense as time goes on. I definitely got caught up
                in the &#34;death&#34; of the live video streaming service, fueled by my now quite old desire to
                celebrate it, which I will hopefully accomplish eventually in a very sentimental essay. If I can
                successfully link them editorially, the subject encompassing Spaces - social audio&#39;s &#34;moment&#34;
                - would also include mention of RSS, &#34;Podcasting&#34; (the term describing the medium,) Spotify, and
                Clubhouse, inevitably. Instead of counting on my future self entirely, however, I&#39;m going to begin
                by discussing that last one.&#xA;&#xA;Clubhouse Blasted Logo&#xA;&#xA;The (‽‽‽th) Social Audio
                Renaissance&#xA;&#xA;Exactly one month ago, I finally broke into Clubhouse thanks to a random kind
                stranger on Twitter who preferred not to be named. April 25th was the first time I set eyes on the app -
                though I could&#39;ve (and usually would&#39;ve) looked up screenshots and/or browsed the litter of how
                tos available, I did not. By this time, I&#39;d accumulated quite a bit of experience with Twitter
                Spaces - derided universally by tech media as a &#34;Clubhouse clone&#34; - and therefore assumed the
                original would be &#34;better,&#34; at least in pure feature terms. What I found, however, was even less
                evidence that anyone building Clubhouse has been/is/intends to be a regular Clubhouse user. Spaces, at
                least, included five emoji reacts for listeners from the beginning: 💯✊✌️👋😂. Clubhouse&#39;s exclusive
                means of Listener-Host interaction is Hand Raising, which is essentially requesting to speak, even
                though the hand waving emoji is literally featured in their logo. (The fact that neither have thought to
                add 🙌 is absolutely inexcusable/inexplicable.)&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1344473573226762241&#xA;&#xA;In
                case you weren&#39;t aware, I appear to enjoy trying out new social services. My password manager is
                full of literally thousands of credentials for social media apps/services/startups - most of which have
                undoubtedly collapsed or been absorbed by a larger entity. Since generating said credentials has become
                such an easy process, especially, I tend to immediately sign up for an account on just about every one I
                hear about. (I even have a Parler profile I cannot bear to actually look at.) Generally, I sign up,
                follow anyone I know from elsewhere if given an account-bridging option, poke around enough to figure
                out whether or not the service in question could add something to my online existence, and end up
                leaving for good. Most of these services are not unique in any way, to a perplexing degree. A few - like
                Pinterest - gain success separately as I give up on trying to integrate them into my life. The miniscule
                remaining percentage, though, end up becoming a part of my daily existence. The most recent of these
                dates back to April 2017, when I first discovered Mastodon.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/0kbps/status/1393792313936146433&#xA;&#xA;The
                Feature Story&#xA;&#xA;&#34;Social Audio&#34; did not begin with Clubhouse. Anchor originally launched
                as a &#34;public radio&#34; app, believe it or not. Extratone&#39;s channel was actually the first to be
                featured in their Music section, once upon a time. Frankly, that happening was the most positive outcome
                of my social media service accumulation habit. More recently, Stereo launched, describing themselves as
                &#34;the premier LIVE broadcast social platform that enables people to have and discover real
                conversations in real time.&#34; Bizarrely, the most legitimate media coverage I could find of Stereo
                was from Glamour UK, and its author definitely spent less than a day actually using the service. Adam
                Corolla remains #1 on its earnings leaderboard and its conversation export feature is a personal
                favorite. The Big WIRED feature on the subject from December of last year does not mention Stereo but
                lists three other &#34;alternatives:&#34; Wavve, Riffr, and Spoon. (None of which are actually
                competitors/alternatives. Sorry, Arielle.)&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1388936080645312520&#xA;&#xA;I
                probably shouldn&#39;t proclaim to be an authority on social audio, but I am definitely a veteran. From
                that context, I must say that Clubhouse is horribly unoriginal - not only in the sense that &#34;successful&#34;
                business implementations of others&#39;, previous ideas tend to be diluted versions of the original, but
                almost pitifully so. I will commend the app&#39;s developers on their somewhat-thorough release notes
                (even though they can be viewed only when first opening the app after an update instead of in the
                designated space on the App Store,) but the extent of linkable Clubhouse documentation amounts to eight
                blog posts and a &#34;Community Guidelines&#34; Notion page. Though I&#39;ve only been a user for one
                month, I wonder what the fuck they&#39;ve been doing since launch, given how sparsely-featured the app
                is at this moment. There are Notifications, Profiles, and Clubs - the latter of which cannot be created
                until a user surpasses an unknown threshold of renown(?) on the app. Competent calendar integration may
                be the service&#39;s singular innovation, though support for Outlook has yet to be added. The Big Issue,
                though, is finding a &#34;talk&#34; to attend that will not drive you utterly insane...&#xA;&#xA;Clubhouse
                Bullshit&#xA;&#xA;The Grand Delusion&#xA;&#xA;I wrote the assumptions at the beginning of this Post in a
                single go after a particularly icky Sunday Clubhouse experience out of a deep concern that&#39;d been
                growing since first exploring the app. The content I&#39;ve found there is not at all what I expected,
                to be honest. I&#39;ve found it almost entirely indecipherable, which makes critique beyond just fucking
                screaming difficult. The New Yorker&#39;s Anna Wiener did a much better job than I could realistically
                manage in &#34;Clubhouse Feels like a Party:&#34;&#xA;&#xA; There was something pleasant about
                meandering from conversation to conversation, as if I had walked into my own home to find a conference
                in full swing. But I also wondered, Why did I let all of these people into my house?&#xA; ...&#xA; It is
                hard to shake the feeling that everyone on Clubhouse is selling something: a company, a workshop, a
                show, a book, a brand.&#xA;&#xA;More recently, her publication&#39;s nemesis declared &#34;The Clubhouse
                Party is Over,&#34; but I wouldn&#39;t know. None of my friends have ever Tweeted a Clubhouse link
                (determinable via this Twitter search.) Very few of the tech industry celebrities I follow have, either
                - pretty much just Chris Messina and Jason Calacanis. This is noteworthy because I believe my list of
                followed accounts on Twitter to be particularly diverse. I actively followed accounts across my various
                interests from ages 15-25 (when I hit my follow limit) and basically never unfollowed anyone. I would
                imagine there are several accounts within that list which I would be ashamed to be associated with, now,
                and yet none have shared a Clubhouse link. Reading any further into this observation would require
                actual data journalism, which I&#39;ll leave to the pros. It does prompt the question, though: if nobody
                I&#39;ve ever known or been interested in on Twitter is using Clubhouse, who in fuck is?&#xA;&#xA;Frankly,
                I do not understand the business incentive behind the massive duplication of other software/services
                defining featuresets of late. I see that Instagram stories have eclipsed Snapchat&#39;s in terms of
                sheer user count, but I do not understand why its leaders would choose to fuck their legacy by such
                blatant idea theft, much less why Twitter, Facebook, Patreon and even fucking LinkedIn have implemented
                nearly-identical featuresets. Though I know Ben Thompson&#39;s word on these matters should be easily
                digestible, I haven&#39;t been able to actually take a bite. For the End User, especially, I cannot even
                begin to conceive of what the leaders behind these decisions imagine the day-to-day experience of the
                average social media user looks like in the near future. How many apps am I going to cycle through to
                get a single story-type piece of content satisfactorily shared? Personally, I currently use three, and
                sharing a single bit individually across all of them one-by-one (since the current state of APIs is not
                conducive to consumer-targeted mass-sharing tools) makes me feel utterly insane.&#xA;&#xA;https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg&#xA;&#xA;My
                lack of understanding would be meaningless if it were not so widely shared among my peers - young,
                brilliant, multifaceted, and distinctly original creators who (in large part) make stuff on the internet
                full-time. They are who I&#39;d actually plan ahead to hear from in a live broadcast setting like
                Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, but Twitch seems to do just fine. For audio broadcasts, specifically, the
                hip, fresh sources which come to mind are all distinctly Open Web: Datafruits.fm, Solarpunk.cool,
                Poolside.fm, and my Mastodon friend Vanta&#39;s stream. The potential of the term &#34;social audio&#34;
                is truly being explored by projects like Rave.DJ - a homegrown, Patreon-funded service for sharing
                mixes/mashups. On a smaller scale, the sky is the limit for Whyp.it as a pure audio playback/annotation
                tool for creators (as developed by Brad Varol, whom I interviewed in March.)&#xA;&#xA;Compared to these,
                most of Clubhouse&#39;s communities seem bleak at best. As I may or may not get around to arguing
                thoroughly about Twitter Spaces, these services&#39; fundamental, near-complete disinterest in Discovery
                of new voices and their subsequent servitude to only their most popular users should be extremely
                worrying for us all - including those who benefit most.&#xA;&#xA;Tinder Obfuscation&#xA;&#xA;The
                Consequences of Strategy&#xA;&#xA;I have more than my fair share of stories and peeves about dating
                apps. On several occasions, for instance, I have corrected those who cite Tinder as the origin of the
                directional swiping interface, explaining that it was actually the now-defunct service Hot or Not who
                did so some 15 years ago. (Why on Earth I am compelled to do so, nobody knows. Not even God.) Somehow,
                though, I think most of us can agree that Tinder is the least shitty of the explicitly hookup-ish
                spectrum of the genre. Or at least, I thought so, until I happened to spy the &#34;Photo Tip&#34;
                embedded above beneath a preview of my profile on the iOS app.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;The
                innocuousness of this advice, which surely would not be dispensed in any other context without
                immediately screaming malice, has been on my mind ever since. It is not the devil who tells you to make
                sure a passing potential match doesn&#39;t immediately learn you have children, but the Marketing Man.
                (Yes, they are distinct. I would explicitly discourage that particular sort of demonization, mostly
                because it has proven completely ineffective as cultural critique.) I am in no position to relevantly
                explore the topic of Society &amp; Sex, generally, other than to insist that most people on Tinder in my
                area, at least, are not looking to leverage it for the dick. They are looking for dates, and a good many
                are working class single mothers. To be clear, I’m not trying to suggest anyone in this demographic
                would be “fooled” by such a suggestion. Offended, perhaps, and/or activated in such a way that would
                lead to them replacing all of their profile’s pictures with photos of just their children. Regardless,
                this social group defined by a distinct lack of free time, if nothing else, represents an antithesis to
                the practice of optimizing one’s swipe ratio.&#xA;&#xA;I think I’ll stop there with this Chapter of
                David Blue’s Tech \~\~Gripes\~\~ Grapes and pledge to arrive back again exclusively through
                haphazard/unintentional means, if I ever do.&#xA;&#xA;media]]&gt;

                <p>I have not been able to follow any more accounts on Twitter – from <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel">@NeoYokel</a>, my primary, eldest account – for several
                    years because of a limit implemented at some point by Twitter and documented in <a
                            href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit">this help document</a>.
                    Considering the breadth of the mechanic&#39;s significance for other users, I have often been
                    compelled to explain this to new followers. Recently, it occurred to me that a handy, brief
                    explainer page might streamline this process, so I created “<a
                            href="https://gist.github.com/extratone/8b762de50de414f8a4be05f9b0407fd8">Why I Didn&#39;t

                    reciprocity in engagement which I can only speculate to occur in the minds of the opposite parties
                    involved in this dynamic, this limitation does not detract from my Twitter life, as I exclusively
                    consume content in Twitter Lists (which I have spoken about extensively, elsewhere.)</p>

                <p>A big theme in my 20s has been coming (slowly) to terms with the fact that I built my entire adult
                    social life around a single, centralized social media Web Site. I mentioned this in <a
                            href="https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review">my Tweetbot 6 review</a>, recently, but –
                    as I also strive to be a more sincere person and spend more time adding value to <em>others</em>’
                    lives – I’ve concluded that it is the time now to speak as openly and vulnerably as I can about my
                    “Social Media Methodology.” Most of the resulting insights will not be new information, but I
                    continue to encounter greater and greater confusion in the face of my well-meaning behavior online
                    and I have decided to stop disregarding it.</p>

                <p>This is <em>not</em> an essay about how to “optimize” your social media use. It is – at least in part
                    – a sort of manifesto against the very idea of designed online behavior beyond simply <strong>being
                        considerate</strong> in a sense that predates even the spoken word. I, myself, have occupied a
                    position well on the <em>chaotic</em> side of the spectrum. You could say I have been mostly <em>chaotic
                        neutral</em> throughout my 12 years on Twitter thus far, and am actively working toward (and
                    advocating for) <em>chaotic good</em>. Perhaps inevitably, I&#39;m going to wade into some
                    experiences with a few specific social media phenomena which I am particularly reacting to, here.

                <ol>
                    <li><p>For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert vague overused
                        marketing jargon noun] will <em>ever</em> result in a substantial accumulation of
                        money/“influence” (which seems to be the diluted zag of “POWER” of the moment.) Those interested
                        in learning about “marketing” should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you
                        to <em>start</em> with Twitter – this I can say with certainty.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form
                        quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user&#39;s choices/methodology to produce
                        results which we <em>have</em>, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it
                        was <em>not</em> created as a <em>game to be won</em>. Perhaps more importantly, the “prize” of
                        “winning” in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, “influence,”
                        relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout
                        the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.</p></li>

                    <li><p>If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social
                        media use is to engage with <em>both</em> strangers and friends in a manner which generally
                        <strong>adds value to the lives of all involved</strong>.</p></li>

                    <li><p>3 is not only <em>possible</em> – it is easily <em>reproducible</em>. Most of my evidence is
                        centered around my own experiences, but I believe – if I took the time – I would be able to find
                        infinitely many publicly-facing examples.</p></li>

                <p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion fairly recently that I need to become brutally frank about the
                    discrepancies I&#39;ve observed between others&#39; accounts of their social media use and my own as
                    soon as possible. The great, ambient grousing summoned throughout The Plague from even the first
                    picogeneration to be born <em>directly</em> into The Social Web really challenged my assumptions
                    about its <em>actual purpose</em> in the day-to-day lives of those in the center of the adoption
                    curve. <em>You mean to tell me you&#39;ve been spending all that societally-alarming time on your
                        phone... On social media services... and you haven&#39;t made a single international friend? Or
                        happened across a single niche community surrounding some bizarre practice or knowledge you&#39;d
                        long thought you were entirely alone in? What exactly have you being doing with all that tapping
                        since your toddlerhood, then?</em> I had absolutely no clue how utterly <em>ineffective</em> the
                    vast majority of n̳o̳r̳m̳i̳e̳s̳ still are at using social media for its general purpose in the most
                    abstract sense: “<em>human connection.</em>“</p>

                <p>The essential realization toward which (I desperately hope) the largesse of America is being carried
                    by conversations around <em><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/pages/anuglytruth">An Ugly
                        Truth</a></em>, as well as countless lower-profile essays, features, academic papers, and
                    general shit shooting is that the responsibility for this ignorance rests <em>solely</em> on the
                    platforms who systematically reformed the controls originally handed over by default to early
                    adopters like me. I would love (for both selfish and very humanitarian reasons) to be able to
                    proclaim some precious, one-of-a-kind genius as the sole differentiator between my complete
                    confidence in my ability to design and maintain social software configurations that have kept my
                    online consumption <em>entirely</em> free of unwanted encounters and the amount of regular
                    involuntary bullshit I hear described in the day-to-day online existence of everyone around me. The
                    truth, I suspect, involves my being of the most privileged category of human in Western civilization
                    combined with the group of high school friends who adopted and socialized me. (A story for another
                    permalink, certainly, if not my equivalent of <em>Trick Mirror</em>.)</p>

                <p>~~More importantly, perhaps, I don&#39;t think I can recall a single instance of sincere malice from
                    within myself toward anyone who&#39;d actually converse with me. On the occasions I have been all
                    huffy and confrontational, I do not remember a single example in which I was unwittingly ejected
                    from a conversation left feeling <em>unsatisfied</em>.~~</p>

                <p>Over the past few months, I&#39;ve started a few Posts for this blog regarding Twitter, its
                    properties, and its recent feature addition frenzy which I&#39;ll probably never finish. I finished
                    the first and narrowest one – the aforelinked Tweetbot 6 review – but the (debatably) most important
                    one – highlighting how irresponsibly and distastefully <a
                            href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/79">Twitter butchered Periscope and built
                        Spaces atop its technology</a> – would make less and less sense as time goes on. I definitely
                    got caught up in the “death” of the live video streaming service, fueled by my now quite old desire
                    to celebrate it, which I will hopefully accomplish <em>eventually</em> in a very sentimental essay.
                    If I can successfully link them editorially, the subject encompassing Spaces – social audio&#39;s
                    “moment” – would also include mention of RSS, “Podcasting” (the term describing the medium,)
                    Spotify, and Clubhouse, inevitably. Instead of counting on my future self entirely, however, I&#39;m
                    going to begin by discussing that last one.</p>

                <p>Exactly one month ago, I finally <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@davidblue">broke into
                    Clubhouse</a> thanks to a random kind stranger on Twitter who preferred not to be named. April 25th
                    was the first time I set eyes on the app – though I could&#39;ve (and usually would&#39;ve) looked
                    up screenshots and/or browsed the litter of how tos available, I did not. By this time, I&#39;d
                    accumulated quite a bit of experience with Twitter Spaces – derided universally by tech media as a
                    “Clubhouse clone” – and therefore assumed the original would be “better,” at least in pure feature
                    terms. What I found, however, was even <em>less</em> evidence that anyone building Clubhouse has
                    been/is/intends to be a regular Clubhouse user. Spaces, at least, included five emoji reacts for
                    listeners from the beginning: 💯✊✌️👋😂. Clubhouse&#39;s exclusive means of Listener-Host
                    interaction is Hand Raising, which is essentially requesting to speak, even though the hand waving
                    emoji is <em><a href="https://joinclubhouse.com/press">literally featured in their logo</a></em>.
                    (The fact that neither have thought to add 🙌 is absolutely inexcusable/inexplicable.)</p>

                <p>In case you weren&#39;t aware, I appear to enjoy trying out new social services. My password manager
                    is full of literally thousands of credentials for social media apps/services/startups – most of
                    which have undoubtedly collapsed or been absorbed by a larger entity. Since generating said
                    credentials has become such an easy process, especially, I tend to immediately sign up for an
                    account on just about every one I hear about. (I even have <a
                            href="https://parler.com/#/user/Extratone">a Parler profile</a> I cannot bear to actually
                    look at.) Generally, I sign up, follow anyone I know from elsewhere if given an account-bridging
                    option, poke around enough to figure out whether or not the service in question could add something
                    to my online existence, and end up leaving for good. Most of these services are <em>not</em> unique
                    in any way, to a perplexing degree. A few – like Pinterest – gain success separately as I give up on
                    trying to integrate them into my life. The miniscule remaining percentage, though, end up becoming a
                    part of my daily existence. The most <em>recent</em> of these dates back to April 2017, when I first
                    discovered <a href="https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview">Mastodon</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="the-feature-story">The Feature Story</h3>

                <p>“Social Audio” did not begin with Clubhouse. Anchor originally launched as a “<a
                        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160209224846/https://anchor.fm/about">public radio</a>” app,
                    believe it or not. <em>Extratone</em>&#39;s channel was actually the <a
                            href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/archived-our-day-11592398">first to be featured</a> in
                    their Music section, once upon a time. Frankly, that happening was the most positive outcome of my
                    social media service accumulation habit. More recently, <a href="https://stereo.com/davidblue">Stereo</a>
                    launched, describing themselves as “<a href="https://stereo.com/about">the premier LIVE broadcast
                        social platform that enables people to have and discover real conversations in real time</a>.”
                    Bizarrely, the most legitimate media coverage I could find of Stereo was <a
                            href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/stereo-app">from </a><em><a
                            href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/stereo-app">Glamour UK</a></em>, and its
                    author definitely spent less than a day actually using the service. Adam Corolla remains #1 on its
                    earnings leaderboard and its <a href="https://youtu.be/0GfGLUbc6fw">conversation export feature</a>
                    is a personal favorite. The <a

                <p>I probably shouldn&#39;t proclaim to be an authority on social audio, but I am definitely a veteran.
                    From that context, I must say that Clubhouse is horribly unoriginal – not only in the sense that
                    “successful” business implementations of others&#39;, previous ideas tend to be diluted versions of
                    the original, but almost pitifully so. I will commend the app&#39;s developers on their
                    somewhat-thorough release notes (even though they can be viewed only when first opening the app
                    after an update instead of <em>in the designated space on the App Store</em>,) but the extent of
                    <em>linkable</em> Clubhouse documentation amounts to <a href="https://joinclubhouse.com/blog">eight
                        blog posts</a> and a “<a
                            href="https://www.notion.so/Community-Guidelines-461a6860abda41649e17c34dc1dd4b5f">Community
                        Guidelines</a>” Notion page. Though I&#39;ve only been a user for one month, I wonder what the
                    fuck they&#39;ve been doing since launch, given how sparsely-featured the app is at this moment.
                    There are Notifications, Profiles, and Clubs – the latter of which cannot be created until a user
                    surpasses an unknown threshold of renown(?) on the app. Competent calendar integration may be the
                    service&#39;s singular innovation, though support for Outlook has yet to be added. The Big Issue,
                    though, is finding a “talk” to attend that will not drive you utterly insane...</p>

                <h3 id="the-grand-delusion">The Grand Delusion</h3>

                <p>I wrote the assumptions at the beginning of this Post in a single go after <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1388930367671910404">a particularly icky Sunday
                    Clubhouse experience</a> out of a deep concern that&#39;d been growing since first exploring the
                    app. The content I&#39;ve found there is not at all what I expected, to be honest. I&#39;ve found it
                    almost entirely indecipherable, which makes critique beyond <a

                    difficult. <em>The New Yorker</em>&#39;s Anna Wiener did a much better job than I could
                    realistically manage in “<a
                            href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/in-the-clubhouse">Clubhouse

                <blockquote><p>There was something pleasant about meandering from conversation to conversation, as if I
                    had walked into my own home to find a conference in full swing. But I also wondered, Why did I let
                    all of these people into my house?</p>

                    <p>...</p>

                    <p>It is hard to shake the feeling that everyone on Clubhouse is selling something: a company, a
                        workshop, a show, a book, a brand.</p></blockquote>

                <p>More recently, her publication&#39;s nemesis declared “<a
                        href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/the-clubhouse-party-is-over">The Clubhouse Party
                    is Over</a>,” but I wouldn&#39;t know. None of my friends have ever Tweeted a Clubhouse link
                    (determinable via <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/search?f=live&pf=on&q=%22joinclubhouse%22&src=typed_query">this
                        Twitter search</a>.) Very few of the tech industry celebrities I follow have, either – pretty
                    much just <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina">Chris Messina</a> and <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/Jason">Jason Calacanis</a>. This is noteworthy because I believe
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/following">my list of followed accounts on Twitter</a> to be
                    particularly diverse. I actively followed accounts across my various interests from ages 15-25 (when
                    I hit my <a href="https://bit.ly/dbfollow">follow limit</a>) and basically <em>never unfollowed
                        anyone</em>. I would imagine there are several accounts within that list which I would be
                    ashamed to be associated with, now, and yet none have shared a Clubhouse link. Reading any further
                    into this observation would require actual data journalism, which I&#39;ll leave to the pros. It
                    does prompt the question, though: if nobody I&#39;ve ever known or been interested in on Twitter is
                    using Clubhouse, <em>who</em> in fuck <em>is</em>?</p>

                <p>Frankly, I do not understand the business incentive behind the massive duplication of other
                    software/services defining featuresets of late. I see that Instagram stories have eclipsed Snapchat&#39;s
                    in terms of <a
                            href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/28/technology/instagram-stories-users/index.html">sheer
                        user count</a>, but I do not understand why its leaders would choose to fuck their legacy by
                    such blatant idea theft, much less why <a
                            href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html">Twitter</a>,

                    have implemented nearly-identical featuresets. Though I know Ben Thompson&#39;s word on these
                    matters should be easily digestible, I haven&#39;t been able to actually take a bite. For the End
                    User, especially, I cannot even begin to conceive of what the leaders behind these decisions imagine
                    the day-to-day experience of the average social media user looks like in the near future. <em>How
                        many apps</em> am I going to cycle through to get a single story-type piece of content
                    satisfactorily shared? Personally, I currently use three, and sharing a single bit individually
                    across all of them one-by-one (since the current state of APIs is not conducive to consumer-targeted
                    mass-sharing tools) makes me feel utterly insane.</p>

                <p>My lack of understanding would be meaningless if it were not so widely shared among my peers – young,
                    brilliant, multifaceted, and distinctly original creators who (in large part) make stuff on the
                    internet full-time. <em>They</em> are who I&#39;d actually plan ahead to hear from in a live
                    broadcast setting like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, but Twitch seems to do just fine. For audio
                    broadcasts, specifically, the <em>hip</em>, fresh sources which come to mind are all distinctly Open
                    Web: <a href="https://datafruits.fm/">Datafruits.fm</a>, <a
                            href="https://solarpunk.cool/magic/computer/club/">Solarpunk.cool</a>, <a
                            href="http://poolside.fm/">Poolside.fm</a>, and my Mastodon friend <a
                            href="https://radio.schizoid.tech/">Vanta&#39;s stream</a>. The potential of the term
                    “social audio” is truly being explored by projects like <a href="https://www.patreon.com/RaveDJ">Rave.DJ</a>
                    – a homegrown, Patreon-funded service for sharing mixes/mashups. On a smaller scale, the sky is the
                    limit for <a href="https://whyp.it/">Whyp.it</a> as a pure audio playback/annotation tool for
                    creators (as developed by Brad Varol, whom I <a href="https://lnns.co/ZSadwt3Hnfi">interviewed in
                        March</a>.)</p>

                <p>Compared to these, most of Clubhouse&#39;s communities seem bleak at best. As I may or may not get
                    around to arguing thoroughly about Twitter Spaces, these services&#39; fundamental, near-complete
                    disinterest in <strong>Discovery</strong> of new voices and their subsequent servitude to only their
                    most popular users should be extremely worrying for us all – including those who benefit most.</p>

                <h2 id="the-consequences-of-strategy">The Consequences of Strategy</h2>

                <p>I have more than my fair share of stories and peeves about dating apps. On several occasions, for
                    instance, I have corrected those who cite Tinder as the origin of the directional swiping interface,
                    explaining that it was actually the now-defunct service Hot or Not who did so some 15 years ago.
                    (Why on Earth I am compelled to do so, nobody knows. Not even God.) Somehow, though, I think most of
                    us can agree that Tinder is the <em>least shitty</em> of the explicitly hookup-ish spectrum of the
                    genre. Or at least, I thought so, until I happened to spy the “Photo Tip” embedded above beneath a
                    preview of my profile on the iOS app.</p>


                <p>The innocuousness of this advice, which surely would not be dispensed in <em>any</em> other context
                    without immediately screaming malice, has been on my mind ever since. It is not the devil who tells
                    you to make sure a passing potential match doesn&#39;t immediately learn you have children, but the
                    Marketing Man. (Yes, they are distinct. I would explicitly discourage that particular sort of
                    demonization, mostly because it has proven completely ineffective as cultural critique.) I am in no
                    position to relevantly explore the topic of Society &amp; Sex, generally, other than to insist that
                    most people on Tinder <em>in my area</em>, at least, are not looking to <em>leverage</em> it <em>for
                        the dick</em>. They are looking for dates, and a good many are working class single mothers. To
                    be clear, I’m not trying to suggest anyone in this demographic would be “fooled” by such a
                    suggestion. Offended, perhaps, and/or activated in such a way that would lead to them replacing all
                    of their profile’s pictures with photos of <em>just</em> their children. Regardless, this social
                    group defined by a distinct lack of free time, if nothing else, represents an antithesis to the
                    practice of <em>optimizing</em> one’s <em>swipe ratio.</em></p>

                <p>I think I’ll stop there with this <em>Chapter of David Blue’s Tech ~~Gripes~~ Grapes</em> and pledge
                    to arrive back again exclusively through haphazard/unintentional means, if I ever do.</p>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Chuck Klosterman&#xA;&#xA;The genius of one Chuck continues to perform to the
                refreshing benefit of scholars in American culture.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA;
                source src=&#34;https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/chuck.m4a&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;Thanks
                to an episode of Peter Kafka&#39;s Recode Media, I&#39;ve just now discovered that former New York Times
                Magazine Ethicist, author of Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs, and longtime men&#39;s interest
                media-affiliated sports and music columnist Chuck Klosterman pronounces his surname kloa-ster-men
                instead of klaw-ster-men as I have been, shamefully – even within earshot of other human beings on a
                handful of occasions. I am willing to submit myself for punishment for these transgressions under the
                single condition that I be allowed to call him Cuck Klusterfuck the next time he ends a spoken sentence
                with &#34;or whatever&#34; in an interview – an unfortunate habit he&#39;s maintained for years. If my
                own byline had any pedigree in the world of literary criticism, I would now collect his penance simply
                by including those hateful, 90s stoner-kid buzzwords in every quote, unedited, but it most certainly
                does not. I&#39;ve searched moderately hard for any reason to bother contributing any criticism of books
                or their authors and returned with very little. I&#39;ve read The Broom of the System and White Girls
                this year, yes, but I&#39;d have to be a Fuck Boy to write anything about David Foster Wallace, and
                Hilton Als’ elegant, genre-busting masterpiece is so far beyond both my societal rights and perceptive
                capacity that I wouldn&#39;t dare utter a single editorialized peep about it – aside from a log
                line-length recommendation – even under immediate threat of certain death.&#xA;&#xA;Given my recent
                voluntary relocation to Portland, Oregon and the word-y pursuits on which I choose to spend all of my
                money and energy, I should adore everything about Chuck Klosterman and in turn he should be completely
                invisible across the under-30 demographic, yet I’ve found a special originality in his voice since first
                exploring it and I think it might be worth requalification. A good friend of mine once dug his first
                novel Downtown Owl out of a bulk box of bargain books she’d bought as a preteen, long ago and became an
                enthusiastic fan of his perspective and a harsh, but fond critic of his persona. It was her copy of his
                second that I read first: The Visible Man – ultimately a surprisingly-original take on the psychologist
                of a gifted outcast tale that classically exemplifies the easy-to-digest yet thoughtfully-exploratory
                reputation of his craft. Thanks to her library card, I was able to follow it up immediately with Chuck’s
                latest, most topical work – an anthology of past essays written for publications like The Guardian,
                Grantland, and GQ entitled X: A Highly Specific, Defiantly Incomplete History of the Early 21st Century,
                which proved an impossibly entertaining, even more polished execution of The Quaint Chuck’s Explanations
                in non-fiction form, beginning at onset with refreshing brevity in its introduction.&#xA;&#xA; I’m not
                fully accredited by either side of the professional equation (sportswriters think I’m too pretentious
                and music writers don’t think I’m pretentious enough,) but I’m able to write about whatever I want, as
                long as it actually happened.&#xA;&#xA;Using “pretentious” even when just vaguely and loosely expressing
                other readers’ thoughts about your work is the first of many miniscule technical infractions against
                convention laid down in X’s arrangement which proves to act toward the benefit of its experience. If you
                substitute car nerds for sportswriters, I’d personally identify with this picoautobiography in a big
                way, but more importantly as a reader I had never encountered anything written about sports which I
                would describe as pretentious, per se, and that realization could very well have birthed enough
                curiosity to land the sale, had I been skimming in a bookshop, which I would’ve eventually been pleased
                with.&#xA;&#xA;Now, during what we should hope to be the first dawn of a new microera of sincerity, we
                must recognize how valuable it is for Klosterman as an observer to be comfortably engaged with his
                subjects, emotionally, and confident in the value of his commentary in middleage without the need to
                insist upon his eccentricity, as so many cringey, culturally-daft Dads do, these days. He uses keywords
                in his writing and spoken publicity that should dismiss him immediately as one of these – a nostalgic,
                out-of-time dork – but are instead somehow magically manipulated to serve him in articulating
                reasonable, even profoundly-innovative insight. As I have explored his bibliography and his
                publicly-expressed thoughts, I have been caught up and hinged on a single supposition: Chuck Klosterman
                is the only white, 46-year-old bearded Portland Dad you should be reading. Do mind that I am in no way
                exempt from this lens, but it’s still my job to determine his viability as an intellectual – a “thought
                leader,” even – for those of us who were conceived around the same time he was wrapping up his
                collegiate sentence at the University of North Dakota.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;For a solid hunk of
                the American reading audience, a quick, elemental vector of quality and mastery we look for in an
                essayist is the ability to “transcend” their subject matter for even the most presumptuous and conceited
                among us, usually to deliver a more abstract sentiment to leave with. Here, Klosterman’s significant
                career experience is irrefutably evident – in X, he achieves this transcendence organically with a
                fluidity unlike anything I’ve read before. We can already check a single box: convincing even a young
                professional twenty-something to shell out for a physical hardback of contemporary non-fiction requiring
                any sort of academic effort to consume is going to be nigh-impossible, even though X actually happens to
                be the best-looking specimen of print product design I have ever handled across cover, type, and layout.
                It’s been difficult having to convince myself to give this copy back.&#xA;&#xA;In the interest of full
                disclosure, I must take special care to emphasize just how highly I regard Peter Kafka as editor and
                interviewer extraordinaire within the Media beat – well-proven to be capable of hitting consistently
                hard on both novel and old guard industry personalities with refined, seemingly unimpeachable
                stone-faced skepticism. However, this Chuck Klosterman interview for Recode Media is an
                uncharacteristically disarmed display of serious admiration: he introduces X with an outright
                confession: &#34;It’s great. I bought it. I bought a signed copy,&#34; which is an unexpected oddity
                (though not an unwelcome one – I’m glad Peter enjoys his life.) Their conversation dips briefly in
                personal history (Chuck and his wife moved to Portland from Brooklyn for its proximity to family) before
                plopping down upon the substance of his clearly superb and matter-of-fact interview technique. I’m not
                sure I’ve ever heard a conversation between Kafka and any previous guests with whom he was quite so
                obviously alike in general disposition.&#xA;&#xA; The only reason I’m able to ask you these questions is
                because I’m a reporter and I can ask you questions now that I probably wouldn’t feel comfortable asking
                you if we were friends, so I’m not going to pretend that we are and I’m not going to create some fake
                thing where we’re going to have a relationship beyond this conversation. I’m just going to ask you the
                things I want to know about and I hope that you respect the fact that I’m just being straight with you.
                I find that that works much better.&#xA;&#xA;From the broadest possible pop cultural lens, Chuck&#39;s
                most spectacular and widely-circulated work, demographically (I assume) is his 2015 interview and cover
                story for GQ with Taylor Swift – then &#34;the most popular human alive.&#34; Yes, it really is worth
                dwelling on the image: this guy... this very Dorky Dad, just hanging out with the most highly-demanded
                teen idol who&#39;s ever lived, sitting awkwardly next to her in the backseat of her car as she
                maniacally panics to accept a call from Justin Timberlake. When one Chucks such a distinguished contrast
                upon such a high-profile contemporary medium, the weight of the potential scrutiny becomes palpable, but
                Klosterman anticipates and braces for this (very risky) business in the only manner he can:
                acknowledging it over and over and over again in the second paragraph of his every interview appearance.&#xA;&#xA;
                It doesn’t matter if it was complimentary or insulting necessarily. It would seem as though I wasn’t
                taking her seriously as a musical artist, and the idea is that I do. That’s why I’m writing about her is
                because I do think she’s a meaningful, significant artist. It’s not worth the risk of having the story
                then get shifted by other people who perhaps just perceive themselves as somebody who’s a watchdog for
                certain signifiers or certain elements of the culture and that their job is to be on the watch for this.
                If your story then gets moved into that silo, that’s all it’s going to be remembered for... It’s a
                touchier thing now. It’s a more dangerous thing.&#xA;&#xA;In the print itself, the cover story is
                prefaced by a very short but uncomfortably-telling complaint about changing expectations for culture
                writers. One might reasonably suggest that Klosterman regards the practice of calling out or remarking
                on “creepy misogyny” as “dumb” – nothing but the byproduct of changing “times.”&#xA;&#xA; Something you
                may notice in the following 2015 feature on Taylor Swift is that I never describe what she looks like or
                how she was dressed, even though I almost always do that with any celebrity I cover... If I did, it
                would be reframed as creepy misogyny and proof that I didn&#39;t take the woman seriously as an artist.
                It would derail everything else about the story. It would become the story.&#xA;&#xA;But… is it? Note
                how desperately close his language comes to the common white guy whining about feminism classification
                without actually fitting the bill. Right…? It doesn’t? Surely, it must be certified Awake through some
                combination of keywords or format I’m unfamiliar with or unable to visually register because
                Klosterman’s ass would have long been grass, otherwise. These 224 words are X’s most contentious, which
                you could call impressive, all things considered – he appears to care enough about his public image to
                curate it somewhat diligently. When a motherhood blogger published an open letter in 2013 citing three
                very ableist uses of the R-word in his work, it only took him two days to respond: “I was wrong. You are
                right.”&#xA;&#xA;More than any other writer of his demographic, Chuck Klosterman has a close, wary
                relationship with the everchanging contextual boundaries of public expression. He knows when to be
                transparent with his feelings on progression, and he&#39;s careful to avoid what could be &#34;problematic&#34;
                for the sake of functioning better as a writer (I assume.) For Slate&#39;s I Have to Ask podcast, he
                managed to speak extensively about these mechanisms for nearly an hour without bellowing anything
                definitively cringey.&#xA;&#xA; I can’t say it’s better or worse. It’s just different, and because it’s
                different, it makes me feel uncomfortable, but there’s actually like an adversarial relationship with
                the history of anything, and that somehow that history is seen as oppressive. And you shouldn’t even
                know about it. It’s better to live in now.&#xA;&#xA;A quick jaunt from pretty horrendous to
                almost-ideal, then. If we are to place our faith in Chuck as our last bearded champion, we must hope
                that last sentence is sincerely intended to be his lens to the changing world. Granted – even if it is
                the truth – it’s not as if persistent acknowledgement of one’s position can miraculously wash away any
                systematic patriarchal dynamics involved in authoring (or reading, for that matter) a high-profile
                feature of a young woman on cover of a magazine which explicitly seeks most to speak to &#34;all sides
                of the male equation,&#34; (are you sure about that, Condé Nast?) especially considering how unlikely it
                would&#39;ve been for me to read anything about Taylor Swift outside of this very white man&#39;s
                anthology. Fundamental themes of power and control are threaded throughout both his fiction and
                non-fiction, which is especially prevalent in the Macho Big Boy cultures of the athletics and music
                industries. In profiling Taylor Swift – the undisputed apex of the latter in 2015 – Klosterman provided
                a firsthand account of the grueling maintenance of a public and private personality under tremendous
                strain from said factors as they were magnified to the max by the most extreme celebrity.&#xA;&#xA; Here
                we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated.
                Because Swift’s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it’s assumed that her social life
                is no less premeditated.&#xA;&#xA;I’m right there with Chuck: I’ve even found a fundamental pillar in
                Power and Control relationships supporting my own fiction experiments: how we attain them, how we lose
                them, and how best to make use of them – all of which had apparently been quite problematic for Taylor
                Swift for most of her adult life, though we wouldn’t be allowed to really comprehend how deep her inner
                turmoil had drilled until it overwhelmed even her expertly-designed self-control four years later,
                boiling over entirely with such unexpected violence that all of America’s pseudorural
                glam-pop-country-glossy-chode-hipsters let out a simultaneous, dangerously-alarmed holler of OH FOR
                PETE’S SAKE that was actually heard and recorded from the overflying orbit of the International Space
                Station.&#xA;&#xA; It’s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her
                famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members
                of the Justice League (&#39;the ectomorph model,&#39; &#39;the inventive indie artist,&#39; &#39;the
                informed third-wave feminist,&#39; etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with
                these attachments.&#xA;&#xA;No, it’s not only worthwhile as an exercise in superbly athletic
                self-awareness – the Taylor profile is profound. I’d recommend reading and treasuring it with or without
                the rest of the anthology because bizarre intersections like these are rare to come by from anybody
                else. Short, sharp, and occasionally somewhat petty notions are what Chuck Klosterman does best and most
                originally. Thanks to a digression of Kafka’s beginning with “you and I are about the same age…,” he
                arrives (by way of REM, believe it or not) at a significant statement about youth and identity.&#xA;&#xA;
                It seems strange to me to be into music for its coolness outside of high school. That seems like that’s
                the only time when you’re a young person and you’re using art basically to create a personality because
                you don’t have a real personality yet.&#xA;&#xA;Klosterman is debatably exempt from the traditional
                academic abstract of “objectivity” for the vast majority of his notable work because of its stated
                primary subject: his “interior life.” Perhaps the success of his voice could be at least partially
                attributed to his development of an existential muscle – a perspective unique enough to entertain, yet
                no less recognizably Midwestern with which he’s been able to reflect particularly clearly on the
                profession in tandem with the experience he’s accumulated over the course of his career.&#xA;&#xA; You
                know, when you’re young, you’re a real emotional writer if you’re a writer… If I was a young person now,
                I would be incredibly attracted to the idea that when you’re 22 you can be a national writer, which was
                impossible when I was 22.&#xA;&#xA;In a way, Klosterman does surmise that it was indeed its objectivity
                that media lost, and that writing is no longer a “one-way relationship,” but a sort of ridiculous dance
                in which “many people feel the reason they’re consuming media is to respond to it… that it’s not for the
                content.” I would remind old Chuck that there are very few functioning adults outside of academia or
                retirement in the United States who spend much of their time reading anything solely for the sake of
                absorption, and the disparity between those who were and weren’t was exponentially greater in the past.
                The story of American media is defined by its cycles of waning and waxing democratization, but many of
                the more traditional avenues in the business have bet on the “two-way relationship” to keep them
                relevant.&#xA;&#xA;My own favorite chapter of the collection is a 2500-word personal essay constructed
                for Grantland to answer a single incongruity: “Why is watching a prerecorded sporting event less
                pleasurable than watching the same game live?” Some form of this question has at least mildly troubled
                every American since the 1960s, including myself, and Klosterman manages to provide an entertaining and
                concise analysis of this plight through his own wisdom. In its short preface in the volume – which was
                written “in 2008, in Europe, when [Chuck] was pretend depressed” is the story of his encounter with a
                house-painting stranger, to whom he explains the meter for success in his opinion-manufacturing
                profession, as he sees it: “If a large number of strangers seem to think one of my opinions is
                especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a perception that I am succeeding at this vocation.”&#xA;&#xA;
                Last weekend I was in a hashish bar in Amsterdam. It was post-dusk, pre-night. The music was terrible
                (fake reggae, late-period Eric Clapton, Sublime deep cuts.) I was sitting next to a British stranger
                with a shaved head and a speech impediment. Our conversation required subtitles, so I imagined them in
                my mind. He told me he had lost three family members within the past year: his mother, who was
                sixty-six; his uncle, who was fifty-six; and his sister, who was forty-six. He said he&#39;d just turned
                thirty-six. He asked if I saw a pattern developing. &#34;Yes,&#34; I said. &#34;But only numerically.&#34;&#xA;
                I asked what he did for a living. He said he was a housepainter. He asked me the same question about
                myself. “I manufacture opinions,” I said.&#xA; “Really?” he asked. “How do you know if you’re any good
                at that?”&#xA; “By the number of people who agree or disagree,” I said in response. “If a large number
                of strangers seem to think one of my opinions is especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a
                perception that I am succeeding at this vocation.”&#xA; “That’s interesting,” said the bald British man
                who could barely speak. “I guess house painting is a totally different thing.”&#xA;&#xA;Rarely are
                situations or discussions that begin with back in my day actually constructive in any sense, but Chuck
                Klosterman appears to be the exception. If you’re willing to indulge him, you may find yourself
                reassured. He now writes from a remote cabin (with WiFi,) was tortured – like all of us – in sifting
                through and compiling his old work for X, and finds its index to be his favorite part.&#xA;&#xA;
                Exploring the index from a book you created is like having someone split your head open with an axe so
                that you can peruse the contents of your brain.&#xA;&#xA;He is willfully and completely ignorant of the
                Harry Potter franchise, yet able to sincerely witness and convey the nuances of back-to-back Creed and
                Nickelback concerts in a confident, fascinating technique of which any other music or culture writer
                would deprive you. He is “almost embarrassed” by his emotional attachment to the Charlie Brown peanuts.
                (See: Chuck Klosterman on Charlie Brown.)&#xA;&#xA; I haven&#39;t watched A Charlie Brown Christmas in
                at least twenty-five years, solely because I can&#39;t emotionally reconcile the final scene.&#xA;&#xA;You’ll
                notice that his entire answer to the live television debacle is – again – entirely about control (or the
                lack thereof.) In fact, his relationship with and desire for control also contributed to his choice of
                profession.&#xA;&#xA; Part of the reason I became a writer is because it was this completely controlled
                reality where I could do this thing by myself where you’d go out and you’d do the interviews and stuff,
                but then you’re back by yourself, transcribing and then writing. Then, when the story is done and you
                send it off, that’s the end. Now that’s the middle. Now it’s like, when the story is published, it’s the
                middle of the process very often because the consumer feels differently now.&#xA;&#xA;While Klosterman’s
                voice is pleasant to someone like me, neither it nor himself necessarily belong to The People. In his X
                review for Paste Magazine, B. David Zarley proclaims essays to be “a love letter to a moment,”
                concluding that Chuck is “’effectively narcissistic,’ proving that culture essays can teach us something
                about ourselves and the people around us.” For The Washington Post, Justin Wm. Moyer notes “it’s hard to
                think of another writer who could make a 30-page, deeply reported essay about a North Dakota
                junior-college basketball game interesting,” suggesting that this new collection marks Klosterman’s
                ascendance from critic to philosopher. From what I’ve read to date, I would counter that he has always
                fulfilled the term to the extent of its usefulness in the 21st century and is even now beginning to
                redefine it. Last January, he braved the “dystopic” Google Gates to speak critically for a crowd of
                Googlers, describing them as “an umbrella over the entire culture,” and urging caution and reflection in
                the coming future to keep them from doing “something bad.” His engagement with them – especially during
                the Q&amp;A – is a fascinating insight into the Greater Google Mind, and I would encourage any invested
                parties in Chuck Klosterman’s role as a philosopher to watch the talk in full. I was unfamiliar with
                “the boat-sails-wind analogy” before I read James Murphy’s interview for LCD Soundsystem’s “last album.”&#xA;&#xA;
                Your life is a boat, the sails are your emotions, and drugs are the wind. When you&#39;re a kid, your
                boat is small and your sail is huge, and drugs are like a hurricane.&#xA;&#xA;Control x Time = the
                Klosterman beat. I suppose this must be what other entertainment writers are referring to when they
                accuse Chuck of nostalgia trafficking, but I can’t be so sure. Though I’d like to think my own snout for
                the stuff is especially well-tuned, I am undeniably from a different planet – even auditorily. All but
                one or two of the musicians interviewed throughout X were entirely unknown to me by name, which
                Klosterman’s voice managed to make even more compelling – not to mention the included stories of
                athletes and the sports industry, which include stories of the human ego, paranoia, and complex drama
                that always manage to transcend their setting when articulated with such dexterity.&#xA;&#xA;I’ve never
                before written a book review of any sort – nor am I defensibly qualified to compare culture writers –
                but with good ole’ Chuck, I dove much further in order to tackle one very important question: should
                Klosterman be recommended reading for anyone under 30 above or alongside bestsellers like George
                Saunders or groundbreaking essayists of color like Hilton Als? In many a case, I must conclude by
                saying, simply, that something of value would be forgone if we shunned Chuck, even if his insight is old
                news to all but the most rudimentary yokels. I have little to offer women or people of color, but I’d
                bet X would prove itself worth a library trip for any idiot white guys in their lives who may be falling
                far behind. I don’t know of any other voices who are in a better position to introduce these issues, nor
                any who are quite so practiced at handling them delicately. While Jenna Wortham-level readers will gain
                little to nothing from this examination or the ecology of its subject (and will likely find themselves
                pausing momentarily for a deserved jest before moving on and returning to their high-level plane of
                complex neoliberal commentary,) but most of their less-aWoken fathers should find in Chuck a man they
                can truly trust, who manages to consistently distill and articulate the need-to-knows of the most
                complex pop culture and pop science conversations without using any of the academic language found in
                most institutional discourse which daddy finds too condescending and superfluous to bear. Those readers
                who’ve absolutely fucking despised my voice so far in this essay should give Klosterman a go – I take as
                much time as I can muster to fiddle with and season the words in context like this work because *I
                basically \enjoy\ the bullshit, yet I’ve found both X and But What If We’re Wrong? remarkably refreshing
                and impressive exercises. &#xA;&#xA; [These are] the cultural conditions in which I was raised under and
                which I pursued journalism under. That was part of the thing that drew me to the idea of being a
                reporter was I was like, this is something I can do, I think. My ability to detach my personal emotions
                from what I am investigating, while not perfect, I can do this. And now it turns out that the opposite
                is what’s desirable. I think it’s really going to change the kind of person who goes into media going
                forward.&#xA;&#xA;Reading Chuck Klosterman is going to be perturbing, but true sincerity is almost
                always uncomfortable. Comprehensively, his nonfiction represents perhaps the most important possible
                behavior to encourage from both the critic and his readership because it incubates and exudes sincere
                curiosity and a genuine interest in learning to listen. From the perspective of quantified societal
                contribution, I’d argue that Klosterman’s craft is a significantly more honorable and worthwhile pursuit
                than greater academic literature in its unique and entertaining treatment of subjects the establishment
                tends to pulverize into minutia. Unless he’s broke and/or bookish, buy X as a gift for your Dad and at
                least give it a try when he’s done. If nothing else, at least read the Taylor Swift interview, okay? If
                he doesn’t enjoy the book, I’m always available if one or both of you need to blow off some steam: give
                me a call at (573) 823-4380. (Normal text messaging / talktime rates will apply*.)&#xA;&#xA;🗎 PRINT/PDF&#xA;&#xA;media]]&gt;

                    Media</em></a>, I&#39;ve just now discovered that former <em>New York Times Magazine</em> Ethicist,
                    author of <em>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs</em>, and longtime men&#39;s interest media-affiliated
                    sports and music columnist Chuck Klosterman pronounces his surname <em>kloa-ster-men</em> instead of
                    <em>klaw-ster-men</em> as <em>I</em> have been, shamefully – even within earshot of other human
                    beings on a handful of occasions. I am willing to submit myself for punishment for these
                    transgressions under the single condition that I be allowed to call him <em>Cuck Klusterfuck</em>
                    the next time he ends a spoken sentence with “or whatever” in an interview – an unfortunate habit he&#39;s
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/NMzPX-MERbU">maintained for years</a>. If my own byline had any pedigree
                    in the world of literary criticism, I would now collect his penance simply by including those
                    hateful, 90s stoner-kid buzzwords in every quote, unedited, but it most certainly does not. I&#39;ve
                    searched moderately hard for any reason to bother contributing any criticism of books or their
                    authors and returned with very little. I&#39;ve read <em>The Broom of the System</em> and <em>White
                        Girls</em> this year, yes, but I&#39;d have to be a <a

                    that I wouldn&#39;t dare utter a single editorialized peep about it – aside from a log line-length
                    recommendation – even under immediate threat of certain death.</p>

                <p>Given my recent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhArAZNF6W7/">voluntary relocation to Portland,
                    Oregon</a> and the word-y pursuits on which I choose to spend all of my money and energy, I should
                    adore everything about Chuck Klosterman and in turn he should be completely invisible across the
                    under-30 demographic, yet I’ve found a special originality in his voice since first exploring it and
                    I think it might be worth requalification. A good friend of mine once dug his <a
                            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/books/review/Meehan-t.html">first novel</a> <a
                            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/books/review/Meehan-t.html"><em>Downtown
                        Owl</em></a> out of a bulk box of bargain books she’d bought as a preteen, long ago and became
                    an enthusiastic fan of his perspective and a harsh, but fond critic of his persona. It was her copy
                    of his second that I read first: <a
                            href="https://www.npr.org/2011/10/04/141015210/visible-man-asks-what-if-no-one-were-watching"><em>The
                        Visible Man</em></a> – ultimately a surprisingly-original take on the <em>psychologist of a
                        gifted outcast</em> tale that classically exemplifies the easy-to-digest yet
                    thoughtfully-exploratory reputation of his craft. Thanks to her library card, I was able to follow
                    it up immediately with Chuck’s latest, most topical work – an anthology of past essays written for
                    publications like <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>Grantland</em>, and <em>GQ</em> entitled <em>X: A
                        Highly Specific, Defiantly Incomplete History of the Early 21st Century</em>, which proved an
                    impossibly entertaining, even more polished execution of The Quaint Chuck’s Explanations in
                    non-fiction form, beginning at onset with refreshing brevity in its <a href="http://bit.ly/ckintro">introduction</a>.
                </p>

                <blockquote><p>I’m not fully accredited by either side of the professional equation (sportswriters think
                    I’m too pretentious and music writers don’t think I’m pretentious enough,) but I’m able to write
                    about whatever I want, as long as it actually happened.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Using “pretentious” even when just vaguely and loosely expressing other readers’ thoughts about your
                    work is the first of many miniscule technical infractions against convention laid down in <em>X</em>’s
                    arrangement which proves to act toward the benefit of its experience. If you substitute <em>car
                        nerds</em> for <em>sportswriters</em>, I’d personally identify with this picoautobiography in a
                    big way, but more importantly as a <em>reader</em> I had never encountered anything written about
                    sports which I would describe as <em>pretentious</em>, per se, and that realization could very well
                    have birthed enough curiosity to land the sale, had I been skimming in a bookshop, which I would’ve
                    eventually been pleased with.</p>

                <p>Now, during what we should hope to be the first dawn of a new microera of sincerity, we must
                    recognize how valuable it is for Klosterman as an observer to be comfortably engaged with his
                    subjects, emotionally, and confident in the value of his commentary in middleage without the need to
                    insist upon his eccentricity, as so many cringey, culturally-daft Dads do, these days. He uses
                    keywords in his writing and spoken publicity that <em>should</em> dismiss him immediately as one of
                    these – a nostalgic, out-of-time dork – but are instead somehow magically manipulated to
                    <em>serve</em> him in articulating reasonable, even profoundly-innovative insight. As I have
                    explored his bibliography and his publicly-expressed thoughts, I have been caught up and hinged on a
                    single supposition: <strong>Chuck Klosterman is the only white, 46-year-old bearded Portland Dad you
                        should be reading</strong>. Do mind that I am in no way exempt from this lens, but it’s still my
                    job to determine his viability as an intellectual – a “thought leader,” even – for those of us who
                    were conceived around the same time he was wrapping up his collegiate sentence at the University of
                    North Dakota.</p>


                <p>For a solid hunk of the American reading audience, a quick, elemental vector of quality and mastery
                    we look for in an essayist is the ability to “transcend” their subject matter for even the most
                    presumptuous and conceited among us, usually to deliver a more abstract sentiment to leave with.
                    Here, Klosterman’s significant career experience is irrefutably evident – in <em>X</em>, he achieves
                    this transcendence organically with a fluidity unlike anything I’ve read before. We can already
                    check a single box: convincing even a young professional twenty-something to shell out for a
                    physical hardback of contemporary non-fiction requiring any sort of academic effort to consume is
                    going to be nigh-impossible, even though <em>X</em> actually happens to be the best-looking specimen
                    of print product design I have ever handled across cover, type, and layout. It’s been difficult
                    having to convince myself to give this copy back.</p>

                <p>In the interest of full disclosure, I must take special care to emphasize just how highly I regard
                    Peter Kafka as editor and interviewer extraordinaire within the Media beat – well-proven to be
                    capable of hitting consistently hard on both <a

                        unimpeachable</a> stone-faced skepticism. However, this Chuck Klosterman interview for <em>Recode
                        Media</em> is an uncharacteristically disarmed display of serious admiration: he introduces <em>X</em>
                    with an outright confession: “It’s great. I bought it. I bought a signed copy,” which is an
                    unexpected oddity (though not an unwelcome one – I’m glad Peter enjoys his life.) Their conversation
                    dips briefly in personal history (Chuck and his wife moved to Portland from Brooklyn for its
                    proximity to family) before plopping down upon the substance of his clearly superb and
                    matter-of-fact interview technique. I’m not sure I’ve ever heard a conversation between Kafka and
                    any previous guests with whom he was quite so obviously alike in general disposition.</p>

                <blockquote><p>The only reason I’m able to ask you these questions is because I’m a reporter and I can
                    ask you questions now that I probably wouldn’t feel comfortable asking you if we were friends, so
                    I’m not going to pretend that we are and I’m not going to create some fake thing where we’re going
                    to have a relationship beyond this conversation. I’m just going to ask you the things I want to know
                    about and I hope that you respect the fact that I’m just being straight with you. I find that that
                    works much better.</p></blockquote>

                <p>From the broadest possible pop cultural lens, Chuck&#39;s most spectacular and widely-circulated
                    work, demographically (I assume) is his <a
                            href="https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story">2015 interview and cover
                        story</a> for <em>GQ</em> with Taylor Swift – then “the most popular human alive.” Yes, it
                    really <em>is</em> worth dwelling on the image: <strong><em>this guy</em></strong>... this very
                    Dorky Dad, just hanging out with the most highly-demanded teen idol who&#39;s ever lived, sitting
                    awkwardly next to her in the backseat of her car as she maniacally panics to accept a call from
                    Justin Timberlake. When one Chucks such a distinguished contrast upon such a high-profile
                    contemporary medium, the weight of the potential scrutiny becomes palpable, but Klosterman
                    anticipates and braces for this (very risky) business in the only manner he can: acknowledging it
                    over and over and <em>over</em> again in the second paragraph of his every interview appearance.</p>

                <blockquote><p>It doesn’t matter if it was complimentary or insulting necessarily. It would seem as
                    though I wasn’t taking her seriously as a musical artist, and the idea is that I do. That’s why I’m
                    writing about her is because I do think she’s a meaningful, significant artist. It’s not worth the
                    risk of having the story then get shifted by other people who perhaps just perceive themselves as
                    somebody who’s a watchdog for certain signifiers or certain elements of the culture and that their
                    job is to be on the watch for this. If your story then gets moved into that silo, that’s all it’s
                    going to be remembered for... It’s a touchier thing now. It’s a more dangerous thing.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>In the <a href="http://bit.ly/ckswiftpreface">print itself</a>, the cover story is prefaced by a very
                    short but uncomfortably-telling complaint about changing expectations for culture writers. One might
                    reasonably suggest that Klosterman regards the practice of calling out or remarking on “creepy
                    misogyny” as “dumb” – nothing but the byproduct of changing “times.”</p>

                <blockquote><p>Something you may notice in the following 2015 feature on Taylor Swift is that I never
                    describe what she looks like or how she was dressed, even though I almost always do that with any
                    celebrity I cover... If I did, it would be reframed as creepy misogyny and proof that I didn&#39;t
                    take the woman seriously as an artist. It would derail everything else about the story. It would
                    <strong>become</strong> the story.</p></blockquote>

                <p>But… <em>is it</em>? Note how desperately close his language comes to the <em>common white guy
                    whining about feminism</em> classification without <em>actually</em> fitting the bill. Right…? It
                    <em>doesn’t</em>? Surely, it must be certified Awake through some combination of keywords or format
                    I’m unfamiliar with or unable to visually register because Klosterman’s ass would have long been
                    grass, otherwise. These 224 words are <em>X</em>’s most contentious, which you could call
                    impressive, all things considered – he appears to care enough about his public image to curate it
                    somewhat diligently. When a motherhood blogger published <a
                            href="https://atypicalson.com/2013/11/07/an-open-letter-to-chuck-klosterman-the-new-york-times-ethicist/">an
                        open letter</a> in 2013 citing three very ableist uses of the R-word in his work, it only took
                    him two days to <a
                            href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kari-wagnerpeck/i-am-the-author-of-the-op_b_4319577.html">respond</a>:
                    “I was wrong. You are right.”</p>

                <p>More than any other writer of his demographic, <strong>Chuck Klosterman has a close, wary
                    relationship with the everchanging contextual boundaries of public expression</strong>. He knows
                    when to be transparent with his feelings on progression, and he&#39;s careful to avoid what could be
                    “problematic” for the sake of functioning better as a writer (I assume.) For <em>Slate</em>&#39;s
                    <em>I Have to Ask</em> podcast, he managed to <a
                            href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/chuck-klosterman-on-how-the-approach-to-cultural-criticism-has-completely-flipped.html">speak
                        extensively</a> about these mechanisms for nearly an hour without bellowing anything
                    definitively cringey.</p>

                <blockquote><p>I can’t say it’s better or worse. It’s just different, and because it’s different, it
                    makes me feel uncomfortable, but there’s actually like an adversarial relationship with the history
                    of anything, and that somehow that history is seen as oppressive. And you shouldn’t even know about
                    it. It’s better to live in now.</p></blockquote>

                <p>A quick jaunt from pretty horrendous to almost-ideal, then. If we are to place our faith in Chuck as
                    our last bearded champion, we must hope that last sentence is sincerely intended to be his lens to
                    the changing world. Granted – even if it <em>is</em> the truth – it’s not as if persistent
                    acknowledgement of one’s position can miraculously wash away any systematic patriarchal dynamics
                    involved in authoring (or reading, for that matter) a high-profile feature of a young woman on cover
                    of a magazine which explicitly seeks most to speak to “<a
                            href="http://www.condenast.com/brands/gq/">all sides of the male equation</a>,” (are you
                    <em>sure about</em> <em>that</em>, Condé Nast?) especially considering how unlikely it would&#39;ve
                    been for me to read anything about Taylor Swift outside of this very white man&#39;s anthology.
                    Fundamental themes of power and control are threaded throughout both his fiction and non-fiction,
                    which is especially prevalent in the Macho Big Boy cultures of the athletics and music industries.
                    In profiling Taylor Swift – the undisputed apex of the latter in 2015 – Klosterman provided a
                    firsthand account of the grueling maintenance of a public and private personality under tremendous
                    strain from said factors as they were magnified to the max by the most extreme celebrity.</p>

                <blockquote><p>Here we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as
                    even more calculated. Because Swift’s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it’s
                    assumed that her social life is no less premeditated.</p></blockquote>

                <p>I’m right there with Chuck: I’ve even found a fundamental pillar in Power and Control relationships
                    supporting my own fiction experiments: <strong>how we attain them</strong>, <strong>how we lose
                        them</strong>, and <strong>how best to make use of them</strong> – all of which had apparently
                    been quite problematic for Taylor Swift for most of her adult life, though we wouldn’t be allowed to
                    <em>really</em> comprehend how deep her inner turmoil had drilled until it overwhelmed even her
                    expertly-designed self-control four years later, <a href="https://youtu.be/3tmd-ClpJxA">boiling over
                        entirely</a> with such unexpected violence that all of America’s pseudorural
                    glam-pop-country-glossy-chode-hipsters let out a simultaneous, dangerously-alarmed holler of <em>OH
                        FOR PETE’S SAKE</em> that was actually heard and recorded from the overflying orbit of the
                    International Space Station.</p>

                <blockquote><p>It’s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her
                    famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like
                    members of the Justice League (&#39;the ectomorph model,&#39; &#39;the inventive indie artist,&#39;
                    &#39;the informed third-wave feminist,&#39; etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely
                    obsessed with these attachments.</p></blockquote>

                <p>No, it’s not <em>only</em> worthwhile as an exercise in superbly athletic self-awareness – the Taylor
                    profile is profound. I’d recommend reading and treasuring it with or without the rest of the
                    anthology because bizarre intersections like these are rare to come by from anybody else. Short,
                    sharp, and occasionally somewhat petty notions are what Chuck Klosterman does best and most
                    originally. Thanks to a digression of Kafka’s beginning with “you and I are about the same age…,” he
                    arrives (by way of REM, believe it or not) at a significant statement about youth and identity.</p>

                <blockquote><p>It seems strange to me to be into music for its coolness outside of high school. That
                    seems like that’s the only time when you’re a young person and you’re using art basically to create
                    a personality because you don’t have a real personality yet.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Klosterman is debatably exempt from the traditional academic abstract of “objectivity” for the vast
                    majority of his notable work because of its stated primary subject: his “interior life.” Perhaps the
                    success of his voice could be at least partially attributed to his development of an existential
                    muscle – a perspective unique enough to entertain, yet no less recognizably Midwestern with which
                    he’s been able to reflect particularly clearly on the profession in tandem with the experience he’s
                    accumulated over the course of his career.</p>

                <blockquote><p>You know, when you’re young, you’re a real emotional writer if you’re a writer… If I was
                    a young person now, I would be incredibly attracted to the idea that when you’re 22 you can be a
                    national writer, which was impossible when I was 22.</p></blockquote>

                <p>In a way, Klosterman does surmise that it <em>was</em> indeed its objectivity that media lost, and
                    that writing is no longer a “one-way relationship,” but a sort of ridiculous dance in which “many
                    people feel the reason they’re consuming media is to respond to it… that it’s not for the content.”
                    I would remind old Chuck that there are very few functioning adults outside of academia or
                    retirement in the United States who spend much of their time reading anything solely for the sake of
                    absorption, and the disparity between those who were and weren’t was exponentially greater in the
                    past. The story of American media is defined by its cycles of waning and waxing democratization, but
                    many of the more traditional avenues in the business have bet on the “two-way relationship” to keep
                    them relevant.</p>

                <p>My own favorite chapter of the collection is a <a
                        href="http://grantland.com/features/space-time-dvr-mechanics/">2500-word personal essay</a>
                    constructed for <em>Grantland</em> to answer a single incongruity: “<strong>Why is watching a
                        prerecorded sporting event less pleasurable than watching the same game live</strong>?” Some
                    form of this question has at least mildly troubled every American since the 1960s, including myself,
                    and Klosterman manages to provide an entertaining and concise analysis of this plight through his
                    own wisdom. In its <a href="http://bit.ly/ckdepressed">short preface</a> in the volume – which was
                    written “in 2008, in Europe, when [Chuck] was pretend depressed” is the story of his encounter with
                    a house-painting stranger, to whom he explains the meter for success in his opinion-manufacturing
                    profession, as he sees it: “If a large number of strangers seem to think one of my opinions is
                    especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a perception that I am succeeding at this
                    vocation.”</p>

                <blockquote><p>Last weekend I was in a hashish bar in Amsterdam. It was post-dusk, pre-night. The music
                    was terrible (fake reggae, late-period Eric Clapton, Sublime deep cuts.) I was sitting next to a
                    British stranger with a shaved head and a speech impediment. Our conversation required subtitles, so
                    I imagined them in my mind. He told me he had lost three family members within the past year: his
                    mother, who was sixty-six; his uncle, who was fifty-six; and his sister, who was forty-six. He said
                    he&#39;d just turned thirty-six. He asked if I saw a pattern developing. “Yes,” I said. “But only
                    numerically.”
                    I asked what he did for a living. He said he was a housepainter. He asked me the same question about
                    myself. “I manufacture opinions,” I said.
                    “Really?” he asked. “How do you know if you’re any good at that?”
                    “By the number of people who agree or disagree,” I said in response. “If a large number of strangers
                    seem to think one of my opinions is especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a perception
                    that I am succeeding at this vocation.”
                    “That’s interesting,” said the bald British man who could barely speak. “I guess house painting is a
                    totally different thing.”</p></blockquote>

                <p>Rarely are situations or discussions that begin with <em>back in my day</em> actually constructive in
                    any sense, but Chuck Klosterman appears to be the exception. If you’re willing to indulge him, you
                    may find yourself reassured. He now writes from a remote cabin (with WiFi,) was tortured – like all
                    of us – in sifting through and compiling his old work for <em>X</em>, and finds its index to be his
                    favorite part.</p>

                <blockquote><p>Exploring the index from a book you created is like having someone split your head open
                    with an axe so that you can peruse the contents of your brain.</p></blockquote>

                <p>He is <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a3556/klosterman1107">willfully and completely

                <p>You’ll notice that his entire answer to the live television debacle is – again – entirely about
                    control (or the lack thereof.) In fact, his relationship with and desire for control also
                    contributed to his choice of profession.</p>

                <blockquote><p>Part of the reason I became a writer is because it was this completely controlled reality

                    then you’re back by yourself, transcribing and then writing. Then, when the story is done and you
                    send it off, that’s the end. Now that’s the middle. Now it’s like, when the story is published, it’s
                    the middle of the process very often because the consumer feels differently now.</p></blockquote>

                <p>While Klosterman’s voice is pleasant to someone like me, neither it nor himself necessarily belong to
                    The People. In his <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/x-chuck-klosterman.html"><em>X</em>
                        review for <em>Paste Magazine</em></a>, B. David Zarley proclaims essays to be “a love letter to
                    a moment,” concluding that Chuck is “’effectively narcissistic,’ proving that culture essays can
                    teach us something about ourselves <em>and</em> the people around us.” <a
                            href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sportswriter-and-rock-n-roll-philosopher-treading-two-sides-of-opposite-worlds/2017/06/30/3aba0fb8-23a5-11e7-bb9d-8cd6118e1409_story.html">For
                        <em>The Washington Post</em></a>, Justin Wm. Moyer notes “it’s hard to think of another writer
                    who could make a 30-page, deeply reported essay about a North Dakota junior-college basketball game
                    interesting,” suggesting that this new collection marks Klosterman’s ascendance from
                    <strong>critic</strong> to <strong>philosopher</strong>. From what I’ve read to date, I would
                    counter that he has always fulfilled the term to the extent of its usefulness in the 21st century
                    and is even now beginning to redefine it. Last January, he braved the “dystopic” Google Gates to <a
                            href="https://youtu.be/HhGA9e-OiFY">speak critically for a crowd of Googlers</a>, describing
                    them as “an umbrella over the entire culture,” and urging caution and reflection in the coming
                    future to keep them from doing “something bad.” His engagement with them – especially during <a
                            href="https://youtu.be/HhGA9e-OiFY?t=36m35s">the Q&amp;A</a> – is a fascinating insight into
                    the Greater Google Mind, and I would encourage any invested parties in Chuck Klosterman’s role as a
                    philosopher to watch the talk in full. I was unfamiliar with “the boat-sails-wind analogy” before I
                    read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/24/lcd-soundsystem-this-is-happening">James
                        Murphy’s interview</a> for LCD Soundsystem’s “last album.”</p>

                <blockquote><p>Your life is a boat, the sails are your emotions, and drugs are the wind. When you&#39;re
                    a kid, your boat is small and your sail is huge, and drugs are like a hurricane.</p></blockquote>

                <p><strong>Control x Time = the Klosterman beat</strong>. I suppose this must be what other
                    entertainment writers are referring to when they <a
                            href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/arts/pop-culture-critic-chuck-klosterman-talks-about-his-new-essay-collection-x-9559383">accuse
                        Chuck of nostalgia trafficking</a>, but I can’t be so sure. Though I’d like to think my own
                    snout for the stuff is especially well-tuned, I am undeniably from a different planet – even
                    auditorily. All but one or two of the musicians interviewed throughout <em>X</em> were entirely
                    unknown to me by name, which Klosterman’s voice managed to make even more compelling – <em>not to
                        mention</em> the included stories of athletes and the sports industry, which include stories of
                    the human ego, paranoia, and complex drama that always manage to transcend their setting when
                    articulated with such dexterity.</p>

                <p>I’ve never before written a book review of any sort – nor am I defensibly qualified to compare
                    culture writers – but with good ole’ Chuck, I dove much further in order to tackle one very
                    important question: <strong>should Klosterman be recommended reading for anyone under 30</strong>
                    above or alongside bestsellers like George Saunders or groundbreaking essayists of color like Hilton
                    Als? In many a case, I must conclude by saying, simply, that <em>something</em> of value would be
                    forgone if we shunned Chuck, even if his insight is old news to all but the most rudimentary yokels.
                    I have little to offer women or people of color, but I’d bet <em>X</em> would prove itself worth a
                    library trip for any idiot white guys in their lives who may be falling far behind. I don’t know of
                    any other voices who are in a better position to introduce these issues, nor any who are quite so
                    practiced at handling them delicately. While Jenna Wortham-level readers will gain little to nothing
                    from this examination or the ecology of its subject (and will likely find themselves pausing
                    momentarily for a deserved jest before moving on and returning to their high-level plane of complex
                    neoliberal commentary,) but most of their less-aWoken fathers should find in Chuck a man they can
                    truly trust, who manages to consistently distill and articulate the need-to-knows of the most
                    complex pop culture and pop science conversations without using any of the academic language found
                    in most institutional discourse which daddy finds too condescending and superfluous to bear. Those
                    readers who’ve absolutely fucking <em>despised</em> my voice so far in this essay should give
                    Klosterman a go – I take as much time as I can muster to fiddle with and season the words in context
                    like this work because <strong>I basically *enjoy* the bullshit</strong>, yet I’ve found both
                    <em>X</em> and <em>But What If We’re Wrong?</em> remarkably refreshing and impressive exercises.</p>

                <blockquote><p>[These are] the cultural conditions in which I was raised under and which I pursued
                    journalism under. That was part of the thing that drew me to the idea of being a reporter was I was
                    like, this is something I can do, I think. My ability to detach my personal emotions from what I am
                    investigating, while not perfect, I can do this. And now it turns out that the opposite is what’s
                    desirable. I think it’s really going to change the kind of person who goes into media going
                    forward.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Reading Chuck Klosterman is going to be perturbing, but true sincerity is almost always
                    uncomfortable. Comprehensively, his nonfiction represents perhaps the most important possible
                    behavior to encourage from both the critic and his readership because it incubates and exudes
                    <strong>sincere curiosity</strong> and a <strong>genuine interest in learning to listen</strong>.
                    From the perspective of quantified societal contribution, I’d argue that Klosterman’s craft is a
                    significantly more honorable and worthwhile pursuit than greater academic literature in its unique
                    and entertaining treatment of subjects the establishment tends to pulverize into minutia. Unless
                    he’s broke and/or bookish, buy <em>X</em> as a gift for your Dad and at least give it a try when
                    he’s done. If nothing else, <em>at least</em> <strong>read the Taylor Swift interview</strong>,
                    okay? If he doesn’t enjoy the book, I’m always available if one or both of you need to blow off some
                    steam: <strong>give me a call at (573) 823-4380</strong>. (<em>Normal text messaging / talktime
                        rates will apply</em>.)</p>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Tump&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;Ten percent of the United States&#39; adult
                population cannot functionally read or write (conservatively) despite the exponential increase of
                required reading in the average American&#39;s day-to-day life thus far in the 21stcentury. For written
                American media, especially, one would assume that a financial and social incentive for maximum literacy
                in the populace should present a straightforward justification for intense widespread coverage of this
                particular disparity, yet most related coverage in mainstream national magazines and newspapers is
                alarmingly sparse and often requires a less-than-socially-conscious context (e.g. a for-profit startup)
                to actually appear in news feeds. From the most wholesome assumption of the industry&#39;s general
                values -- that it holds &#34;newsworthiness&#34; above all -- we must assume that it does not generally
                consider American illiteracy &#34;interesting enough to the general public to warrant reporting&#34; as
                we examine the intermittent discourse surrounding the issue that does achieve publication.&#xA;&#xA;In
                late October, the American business and technology magazine Fast Company covered the recent successes of
                the &#34;for-profit social enterprise&#34; Cell-Ed, noting that &#34;a huge portion of the American
                labor force is illiterate,&#34; which it described as &#34;a hidden epidemic.&#34; The article&#39;s
                author, Rick Wartzman, mentions foremost that Cell-Ed&#39;s userbase is largely &#34;foreign-born&#34;
                and expected to eclipse one million in number by the end of 2019. Demographically, the magazine&#39;s
                readership is predominantly middle to upper-class, who are the least affected social groups by a
                significant margin as per illiteracy&#39;s strong correlative relationship with poverty. These factors
                combine to limit any real social consequences from such an article.&#xA;&#xA;In direct contrast with the
                professional, market-minded perspective of modern business magazine, even niche independent publications
                from the opposite end of the media spectrum often trivialize, belittle, or generally mishandle the
                issue. In a 500-word &#34;Editorial&#34; written by The Editor Eric Black of the Baptist Standard -- a
                small evangelical news website describing itself as &#34;Baptist voices speaking to the challenges of
                today&#39;s world&#34; -- he points to a global increase in &#34;illiterate people,&#34; as he so
                comfortably brands them. Such language is inevitably counter-productive and potentially insensitive: to
                the eyes and ears of activists, educators, and the general public, such a term unnecessarily lends
                toward a restricted perspective of those people who have been left behind by the institution of read and
                written language in one manner or another and portrays them as a great vague collection of lingual
                lepers bearing their own distinct, inexorable, wordless ethnicity which inevitably bars them from the
                freedoms allowed by the Editor&#39;s learned capacity, including the ability to actually read his words
                of affliction. Simply put, he has dangerously oversimplified the issue.&#xA;&#xA;To once again assume
                the best and infer that Black had a specific purpose in publishing his ill-supported opinion beyond
                continuity&#39;s sake of his weekly Editorials, it appears to be the promotion of a local Texan literacy
                &#34;ministry&#34; called Literacy Connexus, though no further specifics about the project are provided
                beyond &#34;helping churches develop literacy programs for their communities, provide training and
                resources to overcome illiteracy,&#34; which is virtually identical to the introductory copy on the
                organization&#39;s homepage.&#xA;&#xA;So far, we&#39;ve examined coverage only in special interest
                media, but what about legacy news organizations with the largest readerships in the United States?
                Despite oblivious use of the same ledes, a newspaper like The Washington Post can wield vast influence
                over the broadest possible readership and the public editorial trust. In November 2016, veteran reporter
                Valerie Strauss published &#34;Hiding in plain sight: The adult literacy crisis&#34; for Answer Sheet --
                her weekly newsletter designed to function as &#34;a school survival guide for parents (and everyone
                else), from education policy to psychology&#34; -- which represents the most substantial discussion of
                American illiteracy in topical, widely-visible media (i.e. presence in a succinct search engine query.)
                She briefly introduces the issue with a bulleted list of illiteracy&#39;s consequences on modern society
                and the individual cited from a Canadian literacy foundation before turning the stage over to Lecester
                Johnson, CEO of the Academy of Hope Adult Public Charter School in Washington D.C.&#xA;&#xA;Johnson
                presents a passionate and well-informed exploration of the state of the literacy battle from the
                perspective of a full-time, locally on-the-ground advocate. Her op-ed&#39;s introduction includes the
                most essential observations and statistics throughout, noting &#34;the children of parents with low
                literacy skills are more likely to live in poverty as adults and are five times more likely to drop out
                of school,&#34; before setting upon a detailed examination of current and relevant organizations working
                toward solutions. Of course, it&#39;s largely centered upon her own organization, which she claims has
                &#34;helped more than 6000 adults rebuild their education and job opportunities since 1985.&#34;&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s
                significant that an institution as deeply embedded across the American political spectrum as The
                Washington Post address the issue of American illiteracy, and both Johnson and Strauss are certainly
                qualified voices for the undertaking, but when we examine this particular article, it&#39;s important we
                consider the context of the Answer Sheet newsletter and its intended audience. Though it&#39;s no
                challenge to pitch the importance of reading and writing to parents and professional educators, the most
                alarming and destructive issue at hand is the educational disparity between their adult peers. &#34;There&#39;s
                a literacy problem in the capitol, but I&#39;m not talking about young people who can&#39;t read. Many
                adults -- perhaps even parents sitting next to you at back to school night -- don&#39;t possess academic
                skills,&#34; notes Johnson with her very first paragraph. However, considering the nature of parenthood,
                the audience primarily consuming these words are undoubtedly preoccupied with juvenile issues,
                specifically, and we can assume their capacity to empathize with their fellow working adults who could
                benefit from literacy education is actually lessened from that of childless readers of the same age as a
                result. &#34;Despite the magnitude of the adult literacy crisis, most of those needing to make up lost
                ground are pushed toward traditional classroom settings--even though many of these people can&#39;t
                possibly follow through because of cost or work schedules or other obstacles,&#34; she attests.&#xA;&#xA;Perhaps
                more than any other American city, Detroit has been struggling with a serious illiteracy problem.
                According to a profile of the Beyond Basics program (which was adapted from an embedded video broadcast)
                on their local ABC affiliate&#39;s website, forty-seven percent of adult Detroiters cannot read, but
                even companies like General Motors -- who donated \$250,000 to the Beyond Basics program earlier in
                mid-October -- are getting involved. The article quotes Elijah Craft, a young man who was &#34;reading
                at a first-grade level as a senior at Detroit&#39;s Central High School.&#34; &#34;Craft would rare
                venture from home for fear he would get lost because he could not read street signs,&#34; reports WXYZ
                anchor Carolyn Clifford. She frames the narrative around a reference to the 2009 film The Blind Side
                starring Sandra Bullock: &#34;here, you might call this story &#39;The Detroit Side.&#39;&#34; For local
                television news, this reference to popular culture likely strengthened the story&#39;s power ensnare
                viewers&#39; emotional attention when it was aired, and even in this written accompaniment, it proves an
                effective -- if a bit crude -- analogy. The broadcast of Mr. Craft&#39;s interview also depicts his own
                deep emotional investment in reading when he begins to shed tears, which is not entirely communicated in
                the written article.&#xA;&#xA;When the American news media discusses American illiteracy, it&#39;s
                almost always in secondary or tertiary form: either by way of a short post for a weekly education
                newsletter, an ultra-low-distribution niche editorial column, or a personality profile of a local
                activist. Perhaps the fundamental obstacle in the face of increasing the discourse surrounding this
                issue is that its resolutions will require -- perhaps more than any other social issue in this country
                -- advocacy by those who can read on behalf of those who cannot because of how sensitive and isolated
                many of them feel. When voices of advocates like Lecester Johnson are uplifted by major organizations
                like The Washington Post, the sociological weight of the illiteracy issue can be very powerful. In
                quoting former United Nations chief Kofi Annan, she sums up for its extensive audience what the facts
                should ultimately mean to them: 32 million of Eric Black&#39;s so-called &#34;illiterate people&#34; in
                the United States of America have been and continue to be deprived of their &#34;human right&#34; to
                functional literacy.&#xA;&#xA;media]]&gt;

                    author, Rick Wartzman, mentions foremost that Cell-Ed&#39;s userbase is largely “foreign-born” and
                    expected to eclipse one million in number by the end of 2019. Demographically, the magazine&#39;s
                    readership is predominantly middle to upper-class, who are the least affected social groups by a
                    significant margin as per illiteracy&#39;s strong correlative relationship with poverty. These
                    factors combine to limit any real social consequences from such an article.</p>

                <p>In direct contrast with the professional, market-minded perspective of modern business magazine, even
                    niche independent publications from the opposite end of the media spectrum often trivialize,
                    belittle, or generally mishandle the issue. In <a
                            href="https://www.baptiststandard.com/opinion/editorials/if-you-can-read-this-be-thankful/">a
                        500-word “Editorial”</a> written by <em>The</em> Editor <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/EricBlackBSP">Eric Black</a> of the <em>Baptist Standard</em> — a
                    small evangelical news website describing itself as “Baptist voices speaking to the challenges of
                    today&#39;s world” — he points to a <em>global</em> increase in “illiterate people,” as he so
                    comfortably brands them. Such language is inevitably counter-productive and potentially insensitive:
                    to the eyes and ears of activists, educators, and the general public, such a term unnecessarily
                    lends toward a restricted perspective of those people who have been left behind by the institution
                    of read and written language in one manner or another and portrays them as a great vague collection
                    of lingual lepers bearing their own distinct, inexorable, wordless ethnicity which
                    <em>inevitably</em> bars them from the freedoms allowed by the Editor&#39;s learned capacity,
                    including the ability to actually read his words of affliction. Simply put, he has dangerously
                    oversimplified the issue.</p>

                <p>To once again assume the best and infer that Black had a specific purpose in publishing his
                    ill-supported opinion beyond continuity&#39;s sake of <a
                            href="https://www.baptiststandard.com/opinion/editorials/">his weekly Editorials</a>, it
                    appears to be the promotion of a local Texan literacy “ministry” called <a
                            href="http://www.literacyconnexus.org/">Literacy Connexus</a>, though no further specifics
                    about the project are provided beyond “helping churches develop literacy programs for their
                    communities, provide training and resources to overcome illiteracy,” which is virtually identical to
                    the introductory copy on <a href="http://www.literacyconnexus.org/">the organization&#39;s
                        homepage</a>.</p>

                <p>So far, we&#39;ve examined coverage only in special interest media, but what about legacy news
                    organizations with the largest readerships in the United States? Despite oblivious use of the same
                    ledes, a newspaper like <em>The Washington Post</em> can wield vast influence over the broadest
                    possible readership and the public editorial trust. In November 2016, veteran reporter Valerie
                    Strauss published “<a
                            href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/11/01/hiding-in-plain-sight-the-adult-literacy-crisis/">Hiding
                        in plain sight: The adult literacy crisis</a>” for <em>Answer Sheet</em> — her weekly newsletter
                    designed to function as “a school survival guide for parents (and everyone else), from education
                    policy to psychology” — which represents the most substantial discussion of American illiteracy in
                    topical, widely-visible media (i.e. presence in a succinct search engine query.) She briefly
                    introduces the issue with a bulleted list of illiteracy&#39;s consequences on modern society and the
                    individual cited from a <a href="https://www.fondationalphabetisation.org/en/">Canadian literacy
                        foundation</a> before turning the stage over to <a
                            href="https://aohdc.org/about-us/staff/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer/">Lecester
                        Johnson</a>, CEO of the <a
                            href="https://aohdc.org/about-us/staff/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer/">Academy of
                        Hope Adult Public Charter School</a> in Washington D.C.</p>

                <p>Johnson presents a passionate and well-informed exploration of the state of the literacy battle from
                    the perspective of a full-time, locally on-the-ground advocate. Her op-ed&#39;s introduction
                    includes the most essential observations and statistics throughout, noting “the children of parents
                    with low literacy skills are more likely to live in poverty as adults and are five times more likely
                    to drop out of school,” before setting upon a detailed examination of current and relevant
                    organizations working toward <em>solutions</em>. Of course, it&#39;s largely centered upon her own
                    organization, which she claims has “helped more than 6000 adults rebuild their education and job
                    opportunities since 1985.”</p>

                <p>It&#39;s significant that an institution as deeply embedded across the American political spectrum as
                    <em>The Washington Post</em> address the issue of American illiteracy, and both Johnson and Strauss
                    are certainly qualified voices for the undertaking, but when we examine this particular article, it&#39;s
                    important we consider the context of the <em>Answer Sheet</em> newsletter and its intended audience.
                    Though it&#39;s no challenge to pitch the importance of reading and writing to parents and
                    professional educators, the most alarming and destructive issue at hand is the educational disparity
                    between <em>their adult peers</em>. “There&#39;s a literacy problem in the capitol, but I&#39;m not
                    talking about young people who can&#39;t read. Many adults — perhaps even parents sitting next to
                    you at back to school night — don&#39;t possess academic skills,” notes Johnson with her very first
                    paragraph. However, considering the nature of parenthood, the audience primarily consuming these
                    words are undoubtedly preoccupied with <em>juvenile</em> issues, specifically, and we can assume
                    their capacity to empathize with their fellow working adults who could benefit from literacy
                    education is actually <em>lessened</em> from that of childless readers of the same age as a result.
                    “Despite the magnitude of the adult literacy crisis, most of those needing to make up lost ground
                    are pushed toward traditional classroom settings—even though many of these people can&#39;t possibly
                    follow through because of cost or work schedules or other obstacles,” she attests.</p>

                <p>Perhaps more than any other American city, Detroit has been struggling with a serious illiteracy
                    problem. According to <a
                            href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/conquering-illiteracy-one-neighborhood-at-a-time-with-beyond-basics-program">a
                        profile of the Beyond Basics program</a> (which was adapted from an embedded video broadcast) on
                    their local ABC affiliate&#39;s website, forty-seven percent of adult Detroiters cannot read, but
                    even companies like General Motors — who donated \$250,000 to the Beyond Basics program earlier in
                    mid-October — are getting involved. The article quotes Elijah Craft, a young man who was “reading at
                    a first-grade level as a senior at Detroit&#39;s Central High School.” “Craft would rare venture
                    from home for fear he would get lost because he could not read street signs,” reports <em>WXYZ</em>
                    anchor <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/about-us/staff/carolyn-clifford">Carolyn Clifford</a>. She
                    frames the narrative around a reference to the 2009 film <em>The Blind Side</em> starring Sandra
                    Bullock: “here, you might call this story &#39;The Detroit Side.&#39;” For local television news,
                    this reference to popular culture likely strengthened the story&#39;s power ensnare viewers&#39;
                    emotional attention when it was aired, and even in this written accompaniment, it proves an
                    effective — if a bit crude — analogy. The broadcast of Mr. Craft&#39;s interview also depicts his
                    own deep emotional investment in reading when he begins to shed tears, which is not entirely
                    communicated in the written article.</p>

                <p>When the American news media discusses American illiteracy, it&#39;s almost always in secondary or
                    tertiary form: either by way of a short post for a weekly education newsletter, an
                    ultra-low-distribution niche editorial column, or a personality profile of a local activist. Perhaps
                    the fundamental obstacle in the face of increasing the discourse surrounding this issue is that its
                    resolutions will require — perhaps more than any other social issue in this country — advocacy by
                    those who <em>can</em> read on behalf of those who <em>cannot</em> because of how sensitive and
                    isolated many of them feel. When voices of advocates like Lecester Johnson <em>are</em> uplifted by
                    major organizations like <em>The Washington Post</em>, the sociological weight of the illiteracy
                    issue can be very powerful. In quoting former United Nations chief Kofi Annan, she sums up for its
                    extensive audience what the facts should ultimately mean to them: 32 million of Eric Black&#39;s
                    so-called “illiterate people” in the United States of America have been and continue to be deprived
                    of their “<strong><em>human right</em></strong>” to functional literacy.</p>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Inmunis Logo&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;All of this may one day be worth
                significantly more revision and/or visibility in the future, but for now, just know that I rambled out
                all of this because it’s by far my most effective way to think, and this darned lowkey blog post has
                just provided a very long-overdue opportunity for it. Please feel free to read or even respond to it, if
                you’d like, but I’d like to ask that you don’t panic or circulate it. Thanks.&#xA;&#xA; So far… the only
                intercorrespondence between staff at Inmunis is people having a problem with one another. &#xA;Before
                Extratone, there was Inmunis﻿ – my first, relatively short-lived attempt to launch an online magazine
                which wasn’t particularly important, but the experience surely did contribute to and inform my
                progression in understanding media that led to my (utter bewildered) current state. Anyhow, it’s fun to
                look back. Here’s the web archive’s last snapshot.&#xA;&#xA;Inmunis Version 1 Web Capture&#xA;&#xA;This,
                a derelict Twitter account, and two film reviews by James Wilson are all that’s left of inmunis.co.uk
                for good reasons – many of which I did not entirely shed when I tried again. Until I started Extratone
                and made doing “this” – incessantly reading/exploring the web, obsessively tinkering and experimenting
                with The Extranet – I actually had very little knowledge on or exposure to the state of digital
                publishing or the real depth of variety to be found with any significant effort to comprehend the
                current offering real, surviving magazines, online or not, yet was dumb and arrogant enough to assume
                that I’d seen it all and none of it was even close to good enough for me to read or seek to write for. I
                was actually delusional enough to regard myself as too smart and one-of-a-kind to lower myself by going
                back to journalism school – that I was so special, anything I put effort in creating was destined to
                turn out superb. Granted, I’d had the actual idea for less than two weeks before I experienced by far
                the most traumatic, soul-destroying, world-upturning, and life-altering event of my entire existence,
                which I think accounts for the insanity, and all of my decisions were inevitably preempted by the fact
                that I was a 21-year-old straight white male community college dropout, which accounts for (but does not
                excuse) their absurdity.&#xA;&#xA;I’ve publicly implied before that it was probably only thanks to
                Drycast – which was also in its infancy during the time of The Big Event (episode 7 was published just
                two days before) – and its weekly obligation to sit down and talk with my favorite people about
                interesting stuff that I did not end up dead or institutionalized in 2015 (I wish I was exaggerating.)
                If there is a Gourd, let it be known that he is fully up-to-date and brand-activated – he sent me a
                fucking podcast to save my life.&#xA;&#xA;Reading and compiling stories for the show notes throughout
                the week provided an early avenue for exploring and embedding myself into media. Beyond the actual
                content, even, it’s been the rationality in the tone which journalists generally adhere to that has
                drawn me in and provided a brighter and brighter guiding light to help keep my sanity in check after my
                world ended because New Media values empathy in tandem with critical thought. All my life, it’s been
                very important to me that I continue to learn the best way to both appear and feel smart and functional.
                I’ve long since accepted that I am very fucking weird – and not in the wow, I dye my hair bright red
                sort of way which helps people feel unique, but in the holy shit, I’m terrified of what would actually
                result in losing control of my facade sort, which is actually much less sinister than it sounds for you,
                and infinitely moreso for me.&#xA;&#xA;This is why I still have a very infantile habit of becoming
                overwhelmingly frustrated with those who socially emphasize and celebrate their “weirdness” as an
                important part of their identity because my self-perception has long since transitioned from regarding
                my deviations as something that made me “unique,” to gigantic obstacles in the way of every possible
                aspiration which I’ll probably never overcome, but am doomed to kill myself trying. I’m now working on
                learning to appreciate those very fucking common people who are determined to prove how strange they are
                because ultimately, my own self-perception is just as ignorant, loneliness is not a virtue, and I’ve
                only maintained the whole charade because I’d rather have delusions of grandeur than acknowledge that I
                am also mostly unoriginal, and most of my truly more “original” behaviors could easily be described as
                simply unhealthy.&#xA;&#xA;This is an important confession for this explanation because its “solution”
                is another crucial motivation behind my creation of Extratone – as both a symbolic and literal means of
                understanding and minimizing my own biases and bitterness by 1) surrounding myself with the huge amount
                young, talented people I knew with great ideas and 2) editorially committing to curiosity as the most
                precious ideal in writing (and in life.)&#xA;&#xA;I do know that – for whatever reason – I really do
                have a special knack for identifying the culture and creators that are truly fresh, innovative, even
                cool among those who can’t comprehend or stand it and the heartbreaking number of those who actualize
                themselves by trying to act aggressively apathetic toward the status quo. This sense is far from 100%
                reliable and is certainly not of a greater quality than everyone on Earth, but I would still confidently
                suggest it’s at least better than most, and – as most of us know – it especially jives with and defines
                the world of magazines.&#xA;&#xA;As I did in Spring 2016, I still believe that Extratone is the best way
                for me to hone my greatest talents and shed my biggest problems – that it is the name I can place on my
                endless journey to improve myself, which – most importantly of all – will all the while achieve the
                tightest possible adhesion to the only meaning of “original” with any significance or real world value
                at all, which serves human curiosity without punishing it in any sense. I could actually just be crazy
                or completely, irrationally inverted – and I know it sounds abstract and preposterous – but I promise
                it’s my best shot at one day performing my optimal function for the world.&#xA;&#xA;The very first thing
                I did after I’d arrived upon these hypotheses and been abruptly forced to cling to them as my last hope
                in life was to obsessively search for a single mantra/battlecry I could drill into my memory and could
                shout under duress – including the temptation to escape the whole lot of it – to succinctly remind
                myself that I had at least one logical chance at a fulfilling life (and yes, it’s still funny that the
                chance is, in fact, a Web Site.)&#xA;&#xA;Scribam quid non legerim is possibly grammatically incorrect
                to a scholar, but it’s the best possible translation I came up with in my Latin research of “I will
                write what I have not read.” It’s cheesy, yes, and a bit cringey in the middle of just any old day when
                it happens to catch my eye where it’s proudly displayed, all-caps, in the footer of our CMS, and – I’ll
                be honest – I don’t know if I could explain it over coffee to a stranger without turning red and
                covering my face, as I once could, but it’s (sincerely, in this one ﻿case) real gravestone material. (As
                in, if someone were to read this after my death, they would be encouraged to receive it as a bonafide
                last wish.)&#xA;&#xA;media]]&gt;

                    started Extratone and made doing “this” – incessantly reading/exploring the web, obsessively
                    tinkering and experimenting with The Extranet – I actually had very little knowledge on or exposure
                    to the state of digital publishing or the real depth of variety to be found with any significant
                    effort to comprehend the current offering real, surviving magazines, online or not, yet was dumb and
                    arrogant enough to assume that I’d seen it all and none of it was even close to good enough for me
                    to read or seek to write for. I was actually delusional enough to regard myself as too smart and
                    one-of-a-kind to lower myself by going back to journalism school – that I was so special, anything I
                    put effort in creating was destined to turn out superb. Granted, I’d had the actual idea for less
                    than two weeks before I experienced by far the most traumatic, soul-destroying, world-upturning, and
                    life-altering event of my entire existence, which I think accounts for the insanity, and all of my
                    decisions were inevitably preempted by the fact that I was a 21-year-old straight white male
                    community college dropout, which accounts for (but does not excuse) their absurdity.</p>

                <p>I’ve publicly implied before that it was probably only thanks to Drycast – which was also in its
                    infancy during the time of The Big Event (episode 7 was published just two days before) – and its
                    weekly obligation to sit down and talk with my favorite people about interesting stuff that I did
                    not end up dead or institutionalized in 2015 (I wish I was exaggerating.) If there is a Gourd, let
                    it be known that he is fully up-to-date and brand-activated – he sent me a fucking podcast to save
                    my life.</p>

                <p>Reading and compiling stories for the show notes throughout the week provided an early avenue for
                    exploring and embedding myself into media. Beyond the actual content, even, it’s been the
                    rationality in the tone which journalists generally adhere to that has drawn me in and provided a
                    brighter and brighter guiding light to help keep my sanity in check after my world ended because New
                    Media values empathy in tandem with critical thought. All my life, it’s been very important to me
                    that I continue to learn the best way to both appear and feel smart and functional. I’ve long since
                    accepted that I am very fucking weird – and not in the wow, I dye my hair bright red sort of way
                    which helps people feel unique, but in the holy shit, I’m terrified of what would actually result in
                    losing control of my facade sort, which is actually much less sinister than it sounds for you, and
                    infinitely moreso for me.</p>

                <p>This is why I still have a very infantile habit of becoming overwhelmingly frustrated with those who
                    socially emphasize and celebrate their “weirdness” as an important part of their identity because my
                    self-perception has long since transitioned from regarding my deviations as something that made me
                    “unique,” to gigantic obstacles in the way of every possible aspiration which I’ll probably never
                    overcome, but am doomed to kill myself trying. I’m now working on learning to appreciate those very
                    fucking common people who are determined to prove how strange they are because ultimately, my own
                    self-perception is just as ignorant, loneliness is not a virtue, and I’ve only maintained the whole
                    charade because I’d rather have delusions of grandeur than acknowledge that I am also mostly
                    unoriginal, and most of my truly more “original” behaviors could easily be described as simply
                    unhealthy.</p>

                <p>This is an important confession for this explanation because its “solution” is another crucial
                    motivation behind my creation of Extratone – as both a symbolic and literal means of understanding
                    and minimizing my own biases and bitterness by 1) surrounding myself with the huge amount young,
                    talented people I knew with great ideas and 2) editorially committing to curiosity as the most
                    precious ideal in writing (and in life.)</p>

                <p>I do know that – for whatever reason – I really do have a special knack for identifying the culture
                    and creators that are truly fresh, innovative, even cool among those who can’t comprehend or stand
                    it and the heartbreaking number of those who actualize themselves by trying to act aggressively
                    apathetic toward the status quo. This sense is far from 100% reliable and is certainly not of a
                    greater quality than everyone on Earth, but I would still confidently suggest it’s at least better
                    than most, and – as most of us know – it especially jives with and defines the world of
                    magazines.</p>

                <p>As I did in Spring 2016, I still believe that Extratone is the best way for me to hone my greatest
                    talents and shed my biggest problems – that it is the name I can place on my endless journey to
                    improve myself, which – most importantly of all – will all the while achieve the tightest possible
                    adhesion to the only meaning of “original” with any significance or real world value at all, which
                    serves human curiosity without punishing it in any sense. I could actually just be crazy or
                    completely, irrationally inverted – and I know it sounds abstract and preposterous – but I promise
                    it’s my best shot at one day performing my optimal function for the world.</p>

                <p>The very first thing I did after I’d arrived upon these hypotheses and been abruptly forced to cling
                    to them as my last hope in life was to obsessively search for a single mantra/battlecry I could
                    drill into my memory and could shout under duress – including the temptation to escape the whole lot
                    of it – to succinctly remind myself that I had at least one logical chance at a fulfilling life (and
                    yes, it’s still funny that the chance is, in fact, a Web Site.)</p>

                <p>Scribam quid non legerim is possibly grammatically incorrect to a scholar, but it’s the best possible
                    translation I came up with in my Latin research of “I will write what I have not read.” It’s cheesy,
                    yes, and a bit cringey in the middle of just any old day when it happens to catch my eye where it’s
                    proudly displayed, all-caps, in the footer of our CMS, and – I’ll be honest – I don’t know if I
                    could explain it over coffee to a stranger without turning red and covering my face, as I once
                    could, but it’s (sincerely, in this one ﻿case) real gravestone material. (As in, if someone were to
                    read this after my death, they would be encouraged to receive it as a bonafide last wish.)</p>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Periscope Death&#xA;&#xA;The social network’s incongruities better its experience,
                if you know how.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA; source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/Twitter-ListsTTS.mp3&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;On
                a recent Tuesday, I opened a just-begun livestream on Facebook from NASA’s official page with a panel of
                experts discussing Europa’s plumes (or something like that) and ended up sticking around for most of its
                hour-long duration because of the ridiculous realtime comments from some of its ~4000 viewers. While
                some participants were genuinely interested in the opportunity to engage the host’s authority with
                relevant and invested questions (which were intermittently fielded,) the vocal majority were aggressive,
                ignorant, and provocative shouts. From my observation, the most noticeably manic and persistent of these
                came from user Shane Langman. “Nasa can telephone the moon in 1969 but can&#39;t get a phone signal in
                death Valley in 2018,” he noted 16 minutes in. “We cant leave the earth or we&#39;d have left it by
                now.” And there was Bobby Smith, who felt compelled to express his authority on NASA’s inauthenticity:
                “[I’ve] been researching since 2012 no real pics of anything all cgi.”&#xA;&#xA;Bobby Smith&#xA;&#xA;Assuming
                the additional all-caps, sans-avatar ranting I remember reading live was deleted after the fact by the
                culprits and/or the page’s administrator, it’s worth noting that the remaining archive is full of
                sincerely positive feedback: “It would be awesome to discover life in europe!!” Indeed.&#xA;&#xA;After a
                few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the broadcast was being simultaneously streamed on
                Periscope (or is it Twitter Video? or Twitter Live?) so I opened both feeds side-by-side to compare
                their audience’s behavior. The Periscope’s viewers averaged about 1000 strong, and their comments were
                noticeably more orderly and decipherable. There was still trolling and self-promotion, but it wasn’t
                allowed to disrupt the rest of the committed discourse, perhaps because of each post’s character limit
                or rationed screen time. Looking between them, the contrast in the user culture and the function of the
                two services during the same, simultaneous stream was at discouraging odds with their respective
                popularity.&#xA;&#xA;Neither are really very good ways to watch live video - Periscope, notably, was
                never designed for professional studio broadcasts - but the relentless malicious nonsense from the
                Facebook viewers pushed all attempts at real engagement away so quickly that I could see no point in
                making them at all. To be blunt: every conceivable corner of Facebook is an unusable cesspool (even in
                the shadow of NASA earnestness,) and its worth considering that something about the design of Twitter
                properties generally discourages such overwhelmingly stupid noise. That’s not to say that harassment,
                hate speech, misogyny, and radical racism have not been religiously neglected or mishandled as has been
                well-reported throughout the network’s history - perhaps even more than any other - but I (a cis white
                man, mind you,) have seen much more of these on Facebook in the wild than I have on Twitter during my
                longtime use of the two, despite spending exponentially more attention on the latter. &#xA;&#xA;In my
                sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood friends, professional acquaintances, and family
                members both distant and immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and spitefully argue with each
                other for the sake of absolutely zero meaningful resolution, conclusion, or intellectual progression. In
                my decade of daily Twitter use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and rapists publicly outed, suicides
                averted, government censorship circumvented, stories broken, artists made, and marginalized voices
                outspoken. I have also Tweeted things in the past (mostly variations of “I want to die”) that would now
                get my account temporarily suspended, as per the company’s latest attempts to minimize its platform’s
                toxicity - an encouraging suggestion that Twitter is finally catching up and learning to avoid its
                cultural blunders, which have been the single greatest exception to its most valuable core identity: its
                mistakes.&#xA;&#xA;Twitter Home&#xA;&#xA;Two weeks ago, Twitter proudly released the first redesign of
                its native Windows 10 app since its debut in 2015 - leading a new generation of upcoming “lightweight”
                Progressive Web Apps and - true to form - immediately reclaimed the title of clumsiest, least-useful
                Twitter client available. PWAs represent the industry’s readiest effort to “bridge the gap between web
                and mobile apps,” for which expanded compatibility must surely be the best case to make. According to
                Google - supreme enemy of the open web and all tasteful design - PWAs are offline-first,
                instant-loading, and immersive - none of which are reasonable priorities in building a Twitter client
                for Windows, an operating system running primarily on very powerful hardware. This sort of idiocy can be
                reasonably expected of Twitter, but bewilderingly, the Great Minds of tech journalism seem to be
                unanimously pleased by this decision, which invites one to suspect that they’ve all switched secretly to
                the exclusive, illustrious HP Elite X3 - the only smartphone on sale running Windows 10, because
                Twitter’s execution of these misaligned goals is mindbogglingly foul to look at and unnecessarily
                frustrating to use. After doing my best to put up with it for a few days, I found myself unable to
                conceieve of a single advantage this new application has over literally any alternative.&#xA;&#xA;3 out
                of the 5 bulleted “highly-requested features” listed in their announcement are just… catching the app up
                with the web client as it’s been for years: the 280-character limit, Explore tab, and Bookmarks.
                “Adding” these web-established operations to an even-more-web-based application surely didn’t present
                much of a workload, but perhaps removing functionality justified the investment. The F and T keys no
                longer operate as shortcuts for liking and retweeting, which is such a misguided oversight that I can’t
                help but wonder if this app was actually intended to be utilized by anyone at all (besides HP Elite
                users.)&#xA;&#xA;Am I missing something? Can you hear me? Are there any flesh-and-blood Twitters users
                left?&#xA;&#xA;Twitter Poll&#xA;&#xA;Then again, the ungainliness of Twitter’s new offspring could be
                attributed to the perpetual tragedy of its mother’s peril. The company’s luck has been on the
                down-and-out for eons in tech time: from its most recent plain text password blunder, to its constant
                inability to handle abuse, its endlessly tumultuous management turnovers, and its growing disinterest
                and disfavor among the public and potential investors alike - our cultural relationship with Twitter and
                its identity as a social network remains dramatically tense well past its tenth year, which is good news
                for its continued survival. One could certainly argue that the Tump presidency alone spared Twitter from
                a painful decline into irrelevance (or at least postponed it,) but I think we should acknowledge by now
                that turmoil is an integral component of the brand as an outlier in the connected community palette.
                &#xA;&#xA;For myself as a long-dependent occupant, its inconsistencies and contradictions are endearing
                and necessary - a competent, profitable, and sensical Twitter may as well be Facebook. If you’ve been
                Tweeting as long as I have, you’ll likely remember that the company’s own offerings had occupied the
                bottom-most position in the hierarchy of preferable available clients throughout time and across all
                manner of operating systems until it finally nailed its Android and iOS software and usurped longtime
                third-party staples like Tweetbot and Twitterific just a few years ago. Gadget blogging and What’s in my
                Dock? videos may very well be long-dead relics of a different era in tech media, but it’s disheartening
                to find through research that the steadily-declining quality of our user experience has been allowed to
                continue without much protest. Justifiably or not, Twitter has persisted in adding stuff nobody likes as
                they’ve gradually neutered all the great third-party development.&#xA;&#xA;TweetDeck for Windows was
                perhaps the most powerful mainstream enduser social application that will ever exist. Before Twitter
                absorbed the tool in 2011, its diverse account integration allowed a user to send a single post across
                Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Google+, and multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously, and they could
                configure the client to do so with just the Enter key! In retrospect, it was naive to assume that such
                potent spam capabilities would continue to be entrusted to the general population without challenge, but
                the modularity and customizability of TweetDeck prime as a standalone application made it useful as hell
                and quite the power trip. Now, it exists only as a tamed, up-to-brand-guidelines web application, yet
                remains the definitive way to use Twitter on a PC if one desires an ad-free, single-window experience if
                only because of its congruence with another, even more forgotten feature of the service: lists.&#xA;&#xA;TweetDeck&#xA;&#xA;This
                is how I’ve seen desktop Twitter since I lasted looked at my timeline in 2010. Since then, I’ve followed
                about 5000 more accounts, so I’d imagine it’s a damned mess. I have a private list of my friends, which
                I try to read in its entirety, and a list of nearly 500 journalists, publications, and musicians whom
                I’ve found particularly fresh and original. Thanks to these, Tweets are presented in order,
                uninterrupted by ads. (They function the same on iOS.) The network’s linear chronology is an absolute
                use condition for me, so I’m thankful I completely missed the beginning of their progression toward
                algorithmic relevance thanks to my lists, and as I’ve since happened upon distress from mutuals and
                non-mutuals over missed or stale Tweets, I have taken the time to relay my gospel: lists are linear. And
                since promoted and sponsored Tweets began overwhelming and perturbing timelines, I’ve seen the
                displeasure and repeated: lists are linear and ad-free!&#xA;&#xA;I realize how irritating it is when one
                plays the why doesn’t anyone listen to me?! card, so I’ve created a Twitter Moment to document the
                confusing silence I’ve gotten in response to these suggestions (though I couldn’t find any cases from
                the past, so I may be misremembering the extent of my charity,) and pledging to refrain from revisiting
                this pet advice of mine when writing about Twitter or other social networks in the future.&#xA;&#xA;#software

                <p>Assuming the additional all-caps, sans-avatar ranting I remember reading live was deleted after the
                    fact by the culprits and/or the page’s administrator, it’s worth noting that the remaining archive
                    is full of sincerely positive feedback: “It would be awesome to discover life in europe!!”
                    Indeed.</p>

                <p>After a few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the broadcast was being simultaneously <a
                        href="https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm">streamed on Periscope</a> (or is it Twitter Video?
                    or Twitter Live?) so I opened both feeds side-by-side to compare their audience’s behavior. The
                    Periscope’s viewers averaged about 1000 strong, and their comments were noticeably more orderly and
                    decipherable. There was still trolling and self-promotion, but it wasn’t allowed to disrupt the rest
                    of the committed discourse, perhaps because of each post’s character limit or rationed screen time.
                    Looking between them, the contrast in the user culture and the function of the two services during
                    the same, simultaneous stream was at discouraging odds with their respective popularity.</p>

                <p>Neither are really very good ways to watch live video – Periscope, notably, was never designed for
                    professional studio broadcasts – but the relentless malicious nonsense from the Facebook viewers
                    pushed all attempts at real engagement away so quickly that I could see no point in making them at
                    all. To be blunt: every conceivable corner of Facebook is an unusable cesspool (even in the shadow
                    of NASA earnestness,) and its worth considering that something about the design of Twitter
                    properties generally discourages such overwhelmingly stupid noise. That’s not to say that
                    harassment, hate speech, misogyny, and radical racism have not been religiously neglected or
                    mishandled as has been well-reported throughout the network’s history – perhaps even more than any
                    other – but I (a cis white man, mind you,) have seen <em>much</em> more of these on Facebook in the
                    wild than I have on Twitter during my longtime use of the two, despite spending exponentially more
                    attention on the latter.</p>

                <p>In my sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood friends, professional acquaintances, and
                    family members both distant and immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and spitefully argue
                    with each other for the sake of absolutely zero meaningful resolution, conclusion, or intellectual
                    progression. In my decade of daily Twitter use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and rapists publicly
                    outed, suicides averted, government censorship circumvented, stories broken, artists made, and
                    marginalized voices outspoken. I have also Tweeted things in the past (mostly variations of “I want
                    to die”) that would now get my account temporarily suspended, as per the company’s <a
                            href="https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/">latest
                        attempts</a> to minimize its platform’s toxicity – an encouraging suggestion that Twitter is
                    finally catching up and learning to avoid its <em>cultural</em> blunders, which have been the single
                    greatest exception to its most valuable core identity: its mistakes.</p>

                <p>Two weeks ago, Twitter <a
                        href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html">proudly
                    released</a> the first redesign of its native Windows 10 app since its debut in 2015 – leading a new
                    generation of upcoming “lightweight” Progressive Web Apps and – true to form – immediately reclaimed
                    the title of clumsiest, least-useful Twitter client available. PWAs represent the industry’s
                    readiest effort to “<a
                            href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the-gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps-a08c76e3e768">bridge</a><a

                        the gap between web and mobile apps</a>,” for which expanded compatibility must surely be the
                    best case to make. <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">According to
                        Google</a> – supreme enemy of the open web and all tasteful design – PWAs are
                    <em>offline-first</em>, <em>instant-loading</em>, and <em>immersive</em> – none of which are
                    reasonable priorities in building a Twitter client for Windows, an operating system running
                    primarily on very powerful hardware. This sort of idiocy can be reasonably expected of Twitter, but
                    bewilderingly, the Great Minds of tech journalism seem to be unanimously pleased by this decision,
                    which invites one to suspect that they’ve all switched secretly to the exclusive, illustrious <a
                            href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/may/18/windows-smartphone-still-worth-buying">HP
                        Elite X3</a> – the only smartphone on sale running Windows 10, because Twitter’s execution of
                    these misaligned goals is mindbogglingly foul to look at and unnecessarily frustrating to use. After
                    doing my best to put up with it for a few days, I found myself unable to conceieve of a single
                    advantage this new application has over literally any alternative.</p>

                <p>3 out of the 5 bulleted “highly-requested features” listed in their <a
                        href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html">announcement</a>
                    are just… catching the app up with the web client as it’s been for years: the 280-character limit,
                    Explore tab, and Bookmarks. “Adding” these web-established operations to an even-more-web-based
                    application surely didn’t present much of a workload, but perhaps <em>removing</em> functionality
                    justified the investment. The F and T keys no longer operate as shortcuts for liking and retweeting,
                    which is such a misguided oversight that I can’t help but wonder if this app was actually intended
                    to be utilized by anyone at all (besides HP Elite users.)</p>

                <p><em>Am I missing something? Can you hear me? Are there any flesh-and-blood Twitters users left?</em>

                <p>Then again, the ungainliness of Twitter’s new offspring could be attributed to the perpetual tragedy
                    of its mother’s peril. The company’s luck has been on the down-and-out for eons in tech time: from
                    its most recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/change-your-twitter-password-right-now/">plain
                        text password blunder</a>, to its constant inability to <a

                        turnovers</a>, and its growing disinterest and disfavor among <a
                            href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/27/16552536/twitter-user-survey-unpopular-abuse-donald-trump">the

                        investors</a> alike – our cultural relationship with Twitter and its identity as a social
                    network remains dramatically tense well past its tenth year, which is good news for its continued
                    survival. One could certainly <a
                            href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/can-donald-trump-save-twitter">argue</a>
                    that the Tump presidency alone spared Twitter from a painful decline into irrelevance (or at least
                    postponed it,) but I think we should acknowledge by now that turmoil is an integral component of the
                    brand as an outlier in the connected community palette.</p>

                <p>For myself as a long-dependent occupant, its inconsistencies and contradictions are endearing and
                    necessary – a competent, profitable, and sensical Twitter may as well be Facebook. If you’ve been
                    Tweeting as long as I have, you’ll likely remember that the company’s own offerings had occupied the
                    bottom-most position in the hierarchy of preferable available clients throughout time and across all
                    manner of operating systems until it finally nailed its Android and iOS software and usurped
                    longtime third-party staples like <a
                            href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/tweetbot-4-0-becomes-the-best-alternative-twitter-client-for-iphone-and-now-ipad/">Tweetbot</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/26/twitterrific-5-ios-update-multi-image-support-videos-gifs/">Twitterific</a>
                    just a few years ago. Gadget blogging and <a href="https://youtu.be/DP5Y-58mHic"><em>What’s in my
                        Dock?</em></a> videos may very well be long-dead relics of a different era in tech media, but
                    it’s disheartening to find through research that the steadily-declining quality of our user
                    experience has been allowed to continue without much protest. Justifiably or not, Twitter has
                    persisted in adding stuff nobody likes as they’ve gradually neutered all the great third-party
                    development.</p>

                <p>TweetDeck for Windows was perhaps the most powerful mainstream enduser social application that will
                    ever exist. Before <a
                            href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/twitter-buys-tweetdeck-for-40-million/">Twitter
                        absorbed the tool</a> in 2011, its <a href="https://youtu.be/HQhnbrwBfSw">diverse account
                        integration</a> allowed a user to send a single post across Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace,
                    Google+, and multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously, and they could configure the client to do so
                    with just the Enter key! In retrospect, it was naive to assume that such potent spam capabilities
                    would continue to be entrusted to the general population without challenge, but the modularity and
                    customizability of TweetDeck prime as a standalone application made it useful as hell and quite the
                    power trip. Now, it exists only as a tamed, up-to-brand-guidelines <a
                            href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com">web application</a>, yet remains the definitive way to
                    use Twitter on a PC if one desires an ad-free, single-window experience if only because of its
                    congruence with another, even more forgotten feature of the service: <em>lists.</em></p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/lGp1lWB.png" alt="TweetDeck"/></p>

                <p>This is how I’ve seen desktop Twitter since I lasted looked at my timeline in 2010. Since then, I’ve
                    followed about 5000 more accounts, so I’d imagine it’s a damned mess. I have a private list of my
                    friends, which I try to read in its entirety, and <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists/the-new">a list of nearly 500 journalists,
                        publications, and musicians</a> whom I’ve found particularly fresh and original. Thanks to
                    these, Tweets are presented in order, uninterrupted by ads. (They function the same on iOS.) The
                    network’s linear chronology is an absolute use condition for me, so I’m thankful I completely missed
                    the
                    <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7g9d/twitter-is-testing-timelines-that-arent-in-chronological-order">beginning
                        of their progression toward algorithmic relevance</a> thanks to my lists, and as I’ve since
                    happened upon distress from mutuals and non-mutuals over <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/daniellemattoon/status/990079819202351104">missed or stale
                        Tweets</a>, I have taken the time to relay my gospel: <em>lists are linear</em>. And since
                    promoted and sponsored Tweets began overwhelming and perturbing timelines, I’ve seen <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/kikkujo/status/996613451349815296">the displeasure</a> and
                    repeated: <em>lists are linear and ad-free</em>!</p>

                <p>I realize how irritating it is when one plays the <em>why doesn’t anyone listen to me?!</em> card, so
                    I’ve created a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176">Twitter Moment</a> to
                    document the confusing silence I’ve gotten in response to these suggestions (though I couldn’t find
                    any cases from the past, so I may be misremembering the extent of my charity,) and pledging to
                    refrain from revisiting this pet advice of mine when writing about Twitter or other social networks
                    in the future.</p>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Mark Fuck&#xA;&#xA;The monumental amount of unsubstantiated gossip and conjecture
                enabled every day by Facebook is lethal to the human intellect. Can fire be fought with fire?&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio
                controls&#xA; source src=&#34;https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/Mark%20Fuck%20and%20the%20Goofy%20Godheads.m4a&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;Today,
                after positing on whether or not a pastry was in fact the namesake of the battleship Bismarck, I was
                told by its owner - a local woman of a far-from-excusable age - that &#34;[I] should be on that big bang
                show.&#34; Upon such fuckery, I looked her in her eyes and informed her that she&#39;d just changed my
                plans for the night: I was now going to go home, wrap my lips around the barrel of my Beretta, and blow
                my brains out. I should&#39;ve known better than to so jest with a boomer immediately after receiving
                such glaring indicators of minimal intellectual function, but I fell for the hope - as I often do, to no
                avail - that such a jarring reaction would encourage reflection on her foul, tragically misled
                sentiments regarding the general state of youth, and perhaps even spare a peer or two from future
                tribulation.&#xA;&#xA;Instead, she called the police.&#xA;&#xA;Three round cops found me, an hour later,
                approaching hesitantly. Strangely enough, they were chuckling - maybe to a little joke about all the
                recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave of blatantly negligent medical care in American
                prisons, though I hope nervous laughter is just SOP when responding to a suicide threat. As all Columbia
                cops always are toward me, they were aggravatingly genuine and hilariously understanding. I began by
                simply recreating my interaction with their summoner, quoting her word-for-word, and - I swear to my new
                Lord - all three immediately released a choral &#34;ohhhhh&#34; in unison. I&#39;ll never know for sure
                if they actually assimilated the reality of the situation so quickly, but it&#39;d certainly seem that
                way.&#xA;&#xA;Clearly, I should&#39;ve threatened her life.&#xA;&#xA;Despite the day-to-day expression
                of our recurring wisdoms, habits, instincts, patterns and cycles of cultural metamorphosis in the
                discourse, the stream of &#34;well, you know they were sayin&#39; the world was going to end when I was
                in elementary school&#34; to my ear has fallen abruptly silent since the inauguration. Our parents and
                grandparents are both impossibly fortunate and unfortunate, having to duck out as the most
                multiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the history of mankind will just&#39;ve begun nibbling
                on the slope to its climax. We&#39;ll be lucky if we&#39;ll still be able to articulate our goodbyes by
                the time they reach the door. Nonsense does a fuckin number on perceived wisdom, but the gaps are
                widening at a dangerous pace. Tectonic or domestic, we are all straddling expanding space, and the chill
                of its draft is now stealing too much of our heat to ignore.&#xA;&#xA;Though it is entertaining in the
                moment (and otherwise redundant,) it would not be well-to-do of me now - nor was it, then - to leave the
                conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes, a part of me would like to campaign for Sheldon to be reclassified
                as an expletive, in disgust, but - as an adult in all-out sprint to make up for stalled emotional
                development - I must note that such a display of concern should&#39;ve been at least reciprocated with a
                bit of explanation, if not appreciation. Still, there are much more appropriate reasons and situations
                in which to waste public servants&#39; time.&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s not news - the Theory is providing some
                ghoulishly skewed portrayal of less-than-forty pseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior&#39;s time was
                worth very little to her, but the fact that she spent any quantity of anything at all engaging with even
                a decidedly mainstream generationally ambassadorial bridge could be regarded - if stretched - as the
                result of a curious seed, which has skyrocketed in human value, as of late. It is undiscouragable. Read
                the trail a bit, and you&#39;ll find that your frustration is simply an expression of the terror that&#39;s
                ignited by the stagnancy of their pace.&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s great that you&#39;ve managed to inch over to
                modern-ish sitcoms from Judge Judy and Independence Day , mom, but you&#39;re gonna have to really pick
                up the pace and work on following a few body modification communities on the darknet.&#xA;&#xA;If an
                absence of solutions are the crux of the blog, here I&#39;m now gloating.&#xA;&#xA;To whom does the
                commoner look to for such solutions when they&#39;d prefer not to terrorize their kooky middle age
                parents into a half century of brutal fasting under vows of silence?&#xA;&#xA;The Big Thinkers!&#xA;The
                Men of the Hour.&#xA;&#xA;Yes, men. All Big Bumbling Billionaire Imbeciles.&#xA;&#xA;Elon Musk cannot be
                the Nicola Tesla of the 21st century, or even the 20th, for that matter, because literally every
                mechanically-minded professional I&#39;ve ever heard talk about battery technology has condemned it in
                some manner as an inescapable dead end, developmentally. Perhaps, then, the champion of electrochemical
                storage is the False Prophet.&#xA;&#xA;No, I&#39;m not capable of citing research or conjuring
                Mars-capable spacecraft, but I&#39;ve been a bit too preoccupied with my country&#39;s class war and its
                10% adult illiteracy rate. It&#39;s all well and good to be privy to romanticism, but it&#39;s not the
                1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes would be more concerned for the wellness of the species than our
                continued reach for the stars, were he still alive.&#xA;&#xA;Well. Maybe not...&#xA;&#xA;Charles
                Lindbergh would be, though.&#xA;&#xA;We spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because
                the smartest among us foresaw some facsimile of the renaissance we are currently experiencing. If they&#39;d
                been shown a glimpse of some statistics on the volume of media we consume, they&#39;d exclaim of their
                pride - no doubt - in their species&#39; capability to progress, and perhaps even their own contribution
                to it. However, extended observation of an average American&#39;s day-to-day life would be lamented, in
                disgust, and a huge portion of the blame can be placed on one t-shirt-touting cyberyokel: Mark
                Zuckerberg.&#xA;&#xA;His name is stupid, his spawn is ruining my life, and he continues to insist upon
                saying shit that frightens the bejesus out of me.&#xA;&#xA;Zuckbrain is fucking scary.&#xA;&#xA;&#34;Wiring
                the globe&#34; is fucking scary.&#xA;&#xA;Jarvis is fucking scary.&#xA;&#xA;But Fuck, himself wouldn&#39;t
                be at all intimidating without his money. The scariest bit is the lack of class in the criticisms of his
                intellectual influence. Farhad Manjoo&#39;s attention has been diligent and premium as a Times er&#39;s
                should be, but the same occupation bars him from authoring with the color of unsubstantiated claims.&#xA;&#xA;Mine
                does not.&#xA;&#xA;Elon Musk is not an apologetic genius. He&#39;s willing to joke about his
                intellectual distance from the planet and its populace on Twitter. Apparently, his mind&#39;s even
                surpassed the need to punctuate. Crazy.&#xA;&#xA;Google is well on it&#39;s way to becoming the
                neo-Vatican... yada yada yada, but they&#39;re too far gone - I do not have the expertise to address
                them. Fuck, though, is a singular short-sleeved, Even Stevens -haired young man without so much as
                private office space (even though his sentiments on breathing room at home are obviously inverse.)&#xA;&#xA;Clearly,
                it&#39;s all just to protect him from the truth: The Apostle John&#39;s Book of Revelation is about
                Facebook. Fuck&#39;s cyberchild is the horseman, the beasts, and the plagues, stuffed into one
                tyrannical website.&#xA;&#xA; And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they
                have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his
                name.&#xA;&#xA;If I can repeatedly trigger accidental voice calls on Fuckbook Messenger, don&#39;t tell
                me it&#39;s not possible to inadvertently live stream myself on the pot.&#xA;&#xA; The beast that thou
                sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that
                dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of
                the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.&#xA;&#xA;Of course, it&#39;s
                unlikely that Mark&#39;s essence was bred entirely of evil, but - like Tump, in many ways - he is an
                excruciatingly wealthy idiot. Though he is spending 2017 touring the United States, he doesn&#39;t seem
                to be all that interested in actually closing the gap between himself and the rest of us, which suggests
                that he only wants us to throw us off his extra-terrestrial, xenophobic scent. I can&#39;t imagine what
                The Mothership would really want with my Amazon browsing history, though.&#xA;&#xA; And another angel
                came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and
                reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.&#xA;&#xA;Just to be
                clear, he is not The Antikhristos.&#xA;&#xA;He&#39;d better not be, anyway.&#xA;I&#39;d be absolutely
                Livid with Lucifer if his choice of a figurehead for his Big Plan was such a Fucking dork.&#xA;&#xA;I
                mean... if Fuck wanted to spend his time crafting 6000-word essays, why the Fuck didn&#39;t he just
                build a Fucking CMS back in his Jesse Eisenberg era instead of the actual weekly-updated tower of
                digital Babylon? Surely, Satan would know better than to waste resources and pulverize creativity by
                ordering his Demonic Dev team to release regular builds for build&#39;s sake rather than on a per-need
                basis, but that&#39;d be because The Tempter is an authority on incentive as thoroughly as Fuck isn&#39;t.&#xA;&#xA;If
                you’re equipped with the privilege of literacy, you’ve been reading a lot about Fuckbook’s political
                consequences, recently. Frankly, it’s about Fucking time, but I’m compelled to emphasize that the most
                significant motor driving the politik is fueled by the eldest, fossilized portions of our thought meat.
                According to Manjoo, &#34;the News Feed team’s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want,&#34;
                dipping in Facebook&#39;s ocean of action data, searching for a soul.&#xA;&#xA;Yet another Fuckism that
                suggests he&#39;s an alien: everybody knows that nobody knows what they want. &#xA;&#xA;There&#39;s a
                central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a whole helluva lot of contradiction. If you&#39;ve
                ever mentioned ADHD with your doctor, or know a hypochondriac/adderall fiend who has, you may have heard
                it described as &#34;the lizard brain.&#34; Simply put, it&#39;s the brain stem, and it&#39;s
                responsible for the most basal and primitively emotional instincts and habits; an anti-intellectual
                agitant, arguing at all times for the course of action with the most immediate gratification. The Great
                Clickbait War of 2013 was a startling demonstration that revealed the strength of the hold Fuckbook had
                (and still has) on these reptilian bits - the true location of its power.&#xA;&#xA;&#34;In surveys,
                people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they
                clicking on them?&#34;&#xA;&#xA;Volition is the Word of the Day. Here, we must once again invoke an
                ancient parable from the wise foretellings of the Disney film, Smart House: when dealing with human
                beings, boundless compliance quickly leads to abject misery for all parties involved.&#xA;&#xA;Mindlessly,
                habitually, endlessly clicking... this is how we die.&#xA;&#xA;Something about Fuck&#39;s direction is
                fundamentally poisonous to the human mind. Yes, he is assuredly too Fucking democratic, but
                misinformation is far from the only form of evil his creation has assumed. If you can jog your memory
                back a bit, you&#39;ll remember a much wider variety of brain-rotting filth.&#xA;&#xA;In lapses of their
                existences&#39; finitude, the 40-something second cousins of the world may still send you the occasional
                Can Crunch Saga invite, jarring you back to Jr. High in 2009, and forever associating themselves in your
                mind with the horrors of mortality and f u c k b o o k g a m e s.&#xA;&#xA;Elon is a more likely
                candidate, but I&#39;ll leave those differentiations to the not-idle cult masses.&#xA;&#xA;More than one
                sixth of all living eyes see Fuckbook every single day, placing its consumption behind only eating and
                drinking as the most universally human activity.&#xA;&#xA;Mr. Fuck achieved his vision and became
                perhaps the greatest purveyor of words who&#39;s ever lived. He&#39;s taught (or... is teaching) us
                something very profound about ourselves: capability is not the whole of the equation. Ability on its own
                cannot guarantee growth, but it can often result in decay. Discussion does not inherently lead to
                connection. Population is not a cure for isolation.&#xA;&#xA;That said, I must begrudgingly admit to you
                that I, myself am one of the 100 million users who&#39;ve depended upon a &#34;very meaningful&#34;
                Fuckbook group for a &#34;physical support structure&#34; for which I have Fuck to thank.&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;ve
                spent half of my existence watching cheesy barnstorming movies, whirling around die-cast biplanes,
                seeking out stories from old pilots - military and commercial, and eventually trained to become one
                myself. As regular activities at young ages do, aviation became deeply ingrained into my identity, but
                my local community is very sparse - it&#39;s not exactly cool, these days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial
                group for members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has allowed me to stay connected to the
                rest of the world&#39;s Soaring Nerds, which is no small deal. It&#39;s the only forum which I am
                compelled to participate in with 100% sincerity and emotional effect.&#xA;&#xA;Photos of members
                standing proudly next to their first airplane, or of adolescent students in a similar pose after their
                first solo, or of three old white rubes on a hangar picnic, laughing around a fold-up table full of
                rudimentary ham sandwiches in front of two gleaming Stearmans...&#xA;&#xA;They tug around on my heart
                like nothing else in life can.&#xA;&#xA;I stopped flying lessons at 16 because I began to see behind the
                naivety of my childhood perception of what it meant to fly commercially and realized that I was
                unequipped for- and uninterested in the sort of challenges it presented. I haven&#39;t flown in seven
                years, but the community will always have a tremendous dividend of my core being. &#xA;&#xA;These days,
                not a single person in my day-to-day life knows or cares about aviation, which wouldn&#39;t be laudable
                whatsoever - it&#39;s not exactly the most relevant goingson at the moment - were it not so emotionally
                necessary for me. &#xA;&#xA;A few days ago, a member shared a photo with the group of Charles Lindbergh&#39;s
                modified Ryan cockpit, captioned &#34;what airplane am I?&#34;&#xA;&#xA;In my youth, Lindbergh filled my
                closest equivalent to the &#39;childhood hero&#39; role. My grandmother bought me a first-edition copy
                of The Spirit of St.Louis from a small town bookshop when I was six or seven, and I carried it literally
                everywhere with me until middle school. I watched the Jimmy Stewart film tens and tens of times, and I
                cried when I saw the Spirit in the flesh at the Smithsonian, yet I&#39;ve never had an informed
                conversation about any of it with another human being. It really warmed me to see how many of the
                comments were correct answers. &#xA;&#xA;Breaking news: it&#39;s nice to know that there are other
                people on Earth who give a shit about the same things you do.&#xA;&#xA;Again - aspiration should always
                be encouraged. This is Fuck&#39;s vision for his creation, and it is feasible, even for myself. At least
                his public persona - however valid or invalid it may be - is making a huge effort to have positive
                consequence, even if his idiocy is imbuing itself within all of humanity.&#xA;&#xA;Fuck is too powerful
                to be exempted from responsibility for what Fuckbook&#39;s done to the Western psyche over the past
                decade, but - like the Christian god - perhaps all we need require is his repentance.&#xA;&#xA;I Refuse
                to Die Clicking&#xA;&#xA;media]]&gt;

                    The monumental amount of unsubstantiated gossip and conjecture enabled every day by Facebook is

                    <audio controls="">
                        <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/Mark%20Fuck%20and%20the%20Goofy%20Godheads.m4a">

                </p>

                <p>Today, after positing on whether or not a pastry was in fact the namesake of the battleship <em>Bismarck</em>,
                    I was told by its owner – a local woman of a far-from-excusable age – that “[I] should be on that
                    big bang show.” Upon such fuckery, I looked her in her eyes and informed her that she&#39;d just
                    changed my plans for the night: I was now going to go home, wrap my lips around the barrel of my
                    Beretta, and blow my brains out. I should&#39;ve known better than to so jest with a boomer
                    immediately after receiving such glaring indicators of minimal intellectual function, but I fell for
                    the hope – as I often do, to no avail – that such a jarring reaction would encourage reflection on
                    her foul, tragically misled sentiments regarding the general state of youth, and perhaps even spare
                    a peer or two from future tribulation.</p>

                <p>Instead, she called the police.</p>

                <p>Three round cops found me, an hour later, approaching hesitantly. Strangely enough, they were
                    chuckling – maybe to a little joke about all the recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave
                    of blatantly negligent medical care in American prisons, though I hope nervous laughter is just <em>SOP</em>
                    when responding to a suicide threat. As all Columbia cops always are toward me, they were
                    aggravatingly genuine and hilariously understanding. I began by simply recreating my interaction
                    with their summoner, quoting her word-for-word, and – I swear to my new Lord – all three immediately
                    released a choral “ohhhhh” in unison. I&#39;ll never know for sure if they actually assimilated the
                    reality of the situation so quickly, but it&#39;d certainly seem that way.</p>

                <p>Clearly, I should&#39;ve threatened <em>her</em> life.</p>

                <p>Despite the day-to-day expression of our recurring wisdoms, habits, instincts, patterns and cycles of
                    cultural metamorphosis in the discourse, the stream of “well, you know they were sayin&#39; the
                    world was going to end when <em>I</em> was in elementary school” to my ear has fallen abruptly
                    silent since the inauguration. Our parents and grandparents are both impossibly fortunate and
                    unfortunate, having to duck out as the most multiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the
                    history of mankind will just&#39;ve begun nibbling on the slope to its climax. We&#39;ll be lucky if
                    we&#39;ll still be able to articulate our goodbyes by the time they reach the door. Nonsense does a
                    fuckin number on perceived wisdom, but the gaps <em>are</em> widening at a dangerous pace. Tectonic
                    or domestic, we are all straddling expanding space, and the chill of its draft is now stealing too
                    much of our heat to ignore.</p>

                <p>Though it is entertaining in the moment (and otherwise redundant,) it would not be
                    <em>well-to-do</em> of me now – nor was it, then – to leave the conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes,
                    a part of me would like to campaign for <em>Sheldon</em> to be reclassified as an expletive, in
                    disgust, but – as an adult in all-out sprint to make up for stalled emotional development – I must
                    note that such a display of concern should&#39;ve been at least reciprocated with a bit of
                    explanation, if not appreciation. Still, there are much more appropriate reasons and situations in
                    which to waste public servants&#39; time.</p>

                <p>It&#39;s not news – the <em>Theory</em> is providing <em>some</em> ghoulishly skewed portrayal of
                    less-than-forty pseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior&#39;s time was worth very little to her,
                    but the fact that she spent any quantity of anything at all engaging with even a decidedly
                    mainstream generationally ambassadorial bridge could be regarded – if stretched – as the result of a
                    curious seed, which has skyrocketed in human value, as of late. It is undiscouragable. Read the
                    trail a bit, and you&#39;ll find that your frustration is simply an expression of the terror that&#39;s
                    ignited by the stagnancy of their pace.</p>

                <p><em>It&#39;s great that you&#39;ve managed to inch over to modern-ish sitcoms from Judge Judy
                    and</em> Independence Day <em>, mom, but you&#39;re gonna have to</em> <strong><em>really pick up
                    the pace</em></strong> <em>and work on following a few body modification communities on the
                    darknet.</em></p>

                <p>If an absence of <em>solutions</em> are the crux of the <em>blog</em>, here I&#39;m now gloating.</p>

                <p>To whom does the commoner look to for such solutions when they&#39;d prefer not to terrorize their
                    kooky middle age parents into a half century of brutal fasting under vows of silence?</p>

                <p>The Big Thinkers!
                    The Men of the Hour.</p>

                <p>Yes, <em>men.</em> All Big Bumbling Billionaire Imbeciles.</p>

                <p>Elon Musk <em>cannot</em> be the Nicola Tesla of the 21st century, or even the <em>20th</em>, for
                    that matter, because literally <em>every</em> mechanically-minded professional I&#39;ve ever heard
                    talk about battery technology has condemned it in some manner as an inescapable dead end,
                    developmentally. Perhaps, then, the champion of electrochemical storage is <em>the</em> False
                    Prophet.</p>

                <p>No, I&#39;m not capable of citing research or conjuring Mars-capable spacecraft, but I&#39;ve been a
                    bit too preoccupied with my country&#39;s class war and its <a href="http://bit.ly/unescoliteracy">10%
                        adult illiteracy rate</a>. It&#39;s all well and good to be privy to romanticism, but it&#39;s
                    not the 1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes would be more concerned for the wellness of the species
                    than our continued reach for the stars, were he still alive.</p>

                <p>Well. Maybe not...</p>

                <p>Charles Lindbergh would be, though.</p>

                <p>We spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because the smartest among us foresaw some
                    facsimile of the renaissance we are currently experiencing. If they&#39;d been shown a glimpse of <a
                            href="http://bit.ly/measuringconsumerinfo">some statistics</a> on the volume of media we
                    consume, they&#39;d exclaim of their pride – no doubt – in their species&#39; capability to
                    progress, and perhaps even their own contribution to it. However, extended observation of an average
                    American&#39;s day-to-day life would be lamented, in disgust, and a <a
                            href="http://bit.ly/millennialspew">huge portion</a> of the blame can be placed on one
                    t-shirt-touting cyberyokel: Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

                <p>His name is stupid, his spawn is ruining my life, and he continues to insist upon saying shit that
                    frightens the bejesus out of me.</p>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://backchannel.com/we-are-entering-the-era-of-the-brain-machine-interface-75a3a1a37fd3">Zuckbrain</a>
                    is fucking scary.</p>

                <p>“<a href="http://bit.ly/zuckfuck">Wiring the globe</a>” is fucking scary.</p>

                <p><a href="http://bit.ly/zuckbot">Jarvis</a> is fucking scary.</p>

                <p>But Fuck, himself wouldn&#39;t be at all intimidating without his money. The scariest bit is the lack
                    of <em>class</em> in the criticisms of his intellectual influence. Farhad Manjoo&#39;s <a
                            href="http://bit.ly/fuckbug">attention</a> has been diligent and premium as a <em>Times</em>
                    er&#39;s should be, but the same occupation bars him from authoring with the color of
                    unsubstantiated claims.</p>

                <p>Mine does not.</p>

                <p>Elon Musk is not an apologetic genius. He&#39;s willing to <a href="http://bit.ly/aloofmusk">joke</a>
                    about his intellectual distance from the planet and its populace on Twitter. Apparently, his mind&#39;s
                    even surpassed the need to punctuate. Crazy.</p>

                <p>Google is well on it&#39;s way to becoming the neo-Vatican... yada yada yada, but they&#39;re too far
                    gone – I do not have the expertise to address them. Fuck, though, is a singular short-sleeved, <em>Even
                        Stevens</em> -haired young man <a href="http://bit.ly/crowdfuck">without</a> so much as private
                    office space (even though his sentiments on breathing room at home are <a
                            href="http://bit.ly/fuckflex">obviously inverse</a>.)</p>

                <p>Clearly, it&#39;s all just to protect him from the truth: <strong>The Apostle John&#39;s</strong>
                    <strong><em>Book of Revelation</em></strong> <strong>is about Facebook</strong>. Fuck&#39;s
                    cyberchild is the horseman, the beasts, <em>and</em> the plagues, stuffed into one tyrannical
                    website.</p>

                <blockquote><p>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day
                    nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>If I can <em>repeatedly</em> trigger accidental voice calls on Fuckbook Messenger, don&#39;t tell me
                    it&#39;s not possible to inadvertently live stream myself on the pot.</p>

                <blockquote><p>The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit,
                    and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written
                    in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is
                    not, and yet is.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Of course, it&#39;s unlikely that Mark&#39;s essence was bred entirely of evil, but – like Tump, in
                    many ways – he is an excruciatingly wealthy idiot. Though he <em>is</em> spending 2017 touring the
                    United States, he <a href="http://bit.ly/fucklearning">doesn&#39;t seem</a> to be all that
                    interested in <em>actually</em> closing the gap between himself and the rest of us, which suggests
                    that he only wants us to throw us off his extra-terrestrial, xenophobic scent. I can&#39;t imagine
                    what <em>The Mothership</em> would really want with my Amazon browsing history, though.</p>

                <blockquote><p>And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the
                    cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the
                    earth is ripe.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Just to be clear, <strong>he is not</strong> <strong><em>The Antikhristos</em></strong>.</p>

                <p>He&#39;d better not be, anyway.
                    I&#39;d be absolutely Livid with Lucifer if his choice of a figurehead for his Big Plan was such a
                    Fucking dork.</p>

                <p>I mean... if Fuck wanted to spend his time crafting 6000-word essays, why the Fuck didn&#39;t he just
                    build a Fucking CMS back in his Jesse Eisenberg era instead of <em>the actual</em> weekly-updated
                    tower of digital Babylon? Surely, Satan would know better than to waste resources and pulverize
                    creativity by ordering his Demonic Dev team to release regular builds for build&#39;s sake rather
                    than on a per-need basis, but that&#39;d be because The Tempter is an authority on
                    <em>incentive</em> as thoroughly as Fuck isn&#39;t.</p>

                <p>If you’re equipped with the privilege of literacy, you’ve been reading a lot about Fuckbook’s
                    political consequences, recently. Frankly, <em>it’s about Fucking time</em>, but I’m compelled to
                    emphasize that the most significant motor driving the politik is fueled by the eldest, fossilized
                    portions of our thought meat. According to Manjoo, “the News Feed team’s ultimate mission is to
                    figure out what users want,” dipping in Facebook&#39;s ocean of action data, searching for a soul.
                </p>

                <p>Yet another Fuckism that suggests he&#39;s an alien: everybody knows that <em>nobody</em> knows what
                    they want.</p>

                <p>There&#39;s a central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a whole helluva lot of
                    contradiction. If you&#39;ve ever mentioned ADHD with your doctor, or know a hypochondriac/adderall
                    fiend who has, you may have heard it described as “the lizard brain.” Simply put, it&#39;s the brain
                    stem, and it&#39;s responsible for the most basal and primitively emotional instincts and habits; an
                    anti-intellectual agitant, arguing at all times for the course of action with the most immediate
                    gratification. <em>The Great Clickbait War</em> of 2013 was a startling demonstration that revealed
                    the strength of the hold Fuckbook had (and still has) on these reptilian bits – the true location of
                    its power.</p>

                <p>“In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true,
                    why were they clicking on them?”</p>

                <p><em>Volition</em> is the Word of the Day. Here, we must once again invoke an ancient parable from the
                    wise foretellings of the Disney film, <em>Smart House</em>: <strong>when dealing with human beings,
                        boundless compliance quickly leads to abject misery for all parties involved.</strong></p>

                <p>Mindlessly, habitually, endlessly clicking... <strong>this is how we die</strong>.</p>

                <p>Something about Fuck&#39;s direction is fundamentally poisonous to the human mind. Yes, he
                    <em>is</em> assuredly too Fucking democratic, but misinformation is far from the only form of evil
                    his creation has assumed. If you can jog your memory back a bit, you&#39;ll remember a much wider
                    variety of brain-rotting filth.</p>

                <p>In lapses of their existences&#39; finitude, the 40-something second cousins of the world may still
                    send you the occasional <em>Can Crunch Saga</em> invite, jarring you back to Jr. High in 2009, and
                    forever associating themselves in your mind with the horrors of mortality and <strong>f u c k b o o
                        k g a m e s.</strong></p>

                <p>Elon is a more likely candidate, but I&#39;ll leave those differentiations to the not-idle cult
                    masses.</p>

                <p>More than one sixth of all living eyes <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/">see</a>
                    Fuckbook every single day, placing its consumption behind only eating and drinking as the most
                    universally human activity.</p>

                <p>Mr. Fuck achieved his vision and became perhaps the greatest purveyor of words who&#39;s ever lived.
                    He&#39;s taught (or... is teaching) us something very profound about ourselves: capability is not
                    the whole of the equation. Ability on its own cannot guarantee growth, but it can often result in
                    decay. Discussion does not inherently lead to <em>connection</em>. Population is not a cure for
                    isolation.</p>

                <p>That said, I must begrudgingly admit to you that I, myself am one of the 100 million users who&#39;ve
                    depended upon a “very meaningful” Fuckbook group for a “physical support structure” for which I have
                    Fuck to thank.</p>

                <p>I&#39;ve spent half of my existence watching cheesy barnstorming movies, whirling around die-cast
                    biplanes, seeking out stories from old pilots – military and commercial, and eventually trained to
                    become one myself. As regular activities at young ages do, aviation became deeply ingrained into my
                    identity, but my local community is <em>very</em> sparse – it&#39;s not exactly <em>cool</em>, these
                    days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial group for members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has
                    allowed me to stay connected to the rest of the world&#39;s Soaring Nerds, which is no small deal.
                    It&#39;s the only forum which I am compelled to participate in with 100% sincerity and emotional
                    effect.</p>

                <p>Photos of members standing proudly next to their first airplane, or of adolescent students in a
                    similar pose after their first solo, or of three old white rubes on a hangar picnic, laughing around
                    a fold-up table full of rudimentary ham sandwiches in front of two gleaming Stearmans...</p>

                <p>They tug around on my heart like nothing else in life can.</p>

                <p>I stopped flying lessons at 16 because I began to see behind the naivety of my childhood perception
                    of what it meant to fly commercially and realized that I was unequipped for- and uninterested in the
                    sort of challenges it presented. I haven&#39;t flown in seven years, but the community will <em>always</em>
                    have a tremendous dividend of my core being.</p>

                <p>These days, not a single person in my day-to-day life knows or cares about aviation, which wouldn&#39;t
                    be laudable whatsoever – it&#39;s not exactly the most relevant goingson at the moment – were it not
                    so <em>emotionally</em> necessary for me.</p>

                <p>A few days ago, a member shared a photo with the group of Charles Lindbergh&#39;s modified Ryan
                    cockpit, captioned “what airplane am I?”</p>

                <p>In my youth, Lindbergh filled my closest equivalent to the &#39;childhood hero&#39; role. My
                    grandmother bought me a first-edition copy of <em>The Spirit of St.Louis</em> from a small town
                    bookshop when I was six or seven, and I carried it <em>literally everywhere</em> with me until
                    middle school. I watched the Jimmy Stewart film tens and tens of times, and I cried when I saw the
                    <em>Spirit</em> in the flesh at the Smithsonian, yet I&#39;ve <em>never</em> had an informed
                    conversation about any of it with another human being. It really warmed me to see how many of the
                    comments were correct answers.</p>

                <p>Breaking news: it&#39;s nice to know that there are other people on Earth who give a shit about the
                    same things you do.</p>

                <p>Again – aspiration should always be encouraged. This is Fuck&#39;s vision for his creation, and it
                    <em>is</em> feasible, even for myself. At least his public persona – however valid or invalid it may
                    be – is making a huge effort to have positive consequence, even if his idiocy is imbuing itself
                    within all of humanity.</p>

                <p>Fuck is too powerful to be exempted from responsibility for what Fuckbook&#39;s done to the Western
                    psyche over the past decade, but – like the Christian god – perhaps all we need require is his
                    repentance.</p>

                <p><em>I Refuse to Die Clicking</em></p>

            <title>Eugen Rochko, Saint of Federated Social</title>
            <link>
            https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview?pk_campaign=rss-feed</link>
            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Mastobird&#xA;&#xA;Eugen Rochko has spent this year perfecting federated social
                media in Mastodon – his open source project. We spoke to him just hours before it became a global tech
                conversation.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;The saga of Twitter, Inc. has been rejuvenated in 2017 by Tump&#39;s
                antics, corporate drama, and an amalgam of user and non-user disquiet with its decisions, though its
                financial viability has been in prominent industry conversation for half a decade. Since its pre-2010
                outset, many &#39;a&#39; feature has accumulated on its original, still-iconic skeletal software, and -
                though the net is undoubtedly positive - a few have gone.&#xA;&#xA;Last Thursday, the company revised in
                bravado its poultrian default profile picture and its system of replies to exclude @s on all of Twitter&#39;s
                proprietary services, drastically changing two of its visual mainstays, and prodding a particularly
                lucent cacophony. Turn your ear, and you&#39;ll hear many familiar terms in the chants: limits, chains,
                strings, harassment, feedback, gamergate, nazis, etc.&#xA;&#xA;These conversations are important, but
                they&#39;ve gotten awfully stale.&#xA;&#xA;If you listen a bit more carefully, you&#39;ll intercept a
                new one:&#xA;&#xA;Mastodon.&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s the open source brainchild of Eugen Rochko, who&#39;s
                known colloquially as Gargron.&#xA;&#xA;He&#39;s had one hell of a week.&#xA;&#xA;Between the night of
                our first emails and our conversation, his flagship mastadon.social instance had doubled in users. Less
                than two hours after we said our goodbyes, his name was on The Verge&#39;s front page.&#xA;&#xA;Despite
                the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just after breakfast on Tuesday to discuss himself
                and the story behind the project, while the most significant day of his life was building around him.&#xA;&#xA;&#34;I&#39;m
                perfectly fine with being called Eugene by Americans.&#34;&#xA;&#xA;Though the ink&#39;s still fresh on
                his compsci diploma, he&#39;s clearly prepared for the American press.&#xA;&#xA;https://open.spotify.com/episode/6QKhv7jaZsAHJxBjyiyZf7?si=Ieqn5Q6Q2aXi04Nq10LJw&#xA;&#xA;------&#xA;&#xA;What&#39;s
                the story behind the project? Do you remember the specific moment when you decided to do this?&#xA;&#xA;Many
                years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated networks when they were a new thing. That was
                when identi.ca was first created - at the very beginning of my developer knowledge and career.&#xA;&#xA;A
                good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have framed it as an alternative to Twitter,
                which early Masto adopters refer to as &#34;Hellbird,&#34; or &#34;the bird website.&#34; Eugen isn&#39;t
                afraid to acknowledge his investment in the format.&#xA;&#xA;I was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn&#39;t
                happy with where Twitter was going, so I decided to check on how the federated stuff was doing in the
                meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought I could contribute.&#xA;&#xA;He began building on
                his own, with Tweetdeck&#39;s standard in mind.&#xA;&#xA; I thought &#39;if I&#39;m going to do
                something, it needs to have realtime updates and it needs to have columns.&#39; I started with a
                bare-bones prototype while still [at University] in May or April of last year. It had no user interface,
                only an API that I was using from the command line. And I thought &#39;okay, it works. that&#39;s great.&#39;
                Then, exams came.&#xA;&#xA;Academics had to come before the project at first, but it soon supplied an
                ample post-graduation diversion. He focused his energy on building something more complete and
                eventually launched a Patreon page.&#xA;&#xA; I announced it on HackerNews, and that was the first
                public release of the project. That&#39;s when I got my first users who weren&#39;t my friends, and some
                who were new to federated networks.&#xA;&#xA;That was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his
                first feedback.&#xA;&#xA; I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the project a bit
                differently. People were a lot more focused on privacy features than I thought they would be, although
                in retrospect, it makes sense. The previous [federated] project - GNU social - did not really have a
                focus on privacy features, or anything built in by default.&#xA;&#xA;It compelled him to change things,
                and his work was well received.&#xA;&#xA; Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new
                users came when it went viral in certain circles. The first was HackerNews and Product Hunt. Aral Balkan
                - a Twitter user with over 30,000 followers - picked up the project, gave it a shout out, and even did a

                was Marxist anime Twitter (including Extratone and I.)&#xA;&#xA;Lots of furries; lots of LGBT people.

                individuals needed a safer platform than Twitter could offer.&#xA;&#xA;Sidekick dashboard background

                Tuesday morning.&#xA;&#xA;&#34;As you can see, the first bump is HackerNews, the second is Aral Balkan,
                and then anime/Marxist Twitter.&#34;&#xA;&#xA;And the last - now a bit out of date - is this week&#39;s
                spike, which is nearly double all previous waves.&#xA;&#xA;Are you responsible for all of the code?&#xA;&#xA;You
                can look at the GitHub page to see a specific breakdown of who contributed and how many lines of code,
                each. You&#39;ll see I&#39;m at the top by a large margin, but there are [additional] people who&#39;ve
                contributed interesting, good features &amp; fixes, localizations, user guides, and documentation.&#xA;&#xA;What&#39;s
                the story behind the name?&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s not particularly interesting. I&#39;m a progressive metal
                fan, and I listen to Mastodon sometimes. They have a really cool name that refers to a really cool
                animal. It&#39;s a fluffy elephant! What&#39;s not to love?&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s also the inspiration for
                Mastodon&#39;s mascot, which was penned by Rochko&#39;s YouTuber friend Dopatwo after he realized how
                urgently he required an error page.&#xA;&#xA;What does &#34;federated&#34; mean to you?&#xA;&#xA;The
                biggest problem with this term is that it&#39;s new for lots of people. People who&#39;ve come across
                federated networks in the past instantly understand what it means and how it works, and people who are
                new to the concept have a lot of trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first started, people didn&#39;t
                understand what &#39;retweeting&#39; meant, so it&#39;s not a unique problem domain.&#xA;&#xA;I don&#39;t
                know where it comes from - maybe BitTorrent - but people seem to think that when something is &#39;decentralized,&#39;
                everybody gets the same thing; that it&#39;s all synchronized one to one. In actuality, &#39;federated&#39;
                means that people in different instances can talk to each other, but the content is different depending
                on the users there, what they do, and who they follow.&#xA;&#xA;Though instances are infrastructurally
                independent, they can communicate with one another. On a user level, timelines are still determined by
                who you do and do not follow across the entirety of all instances. &#xA;&#xA;What if Twitter comes to
                you in the near future with a job offer?&#xA;&#xA;[Rochko laughs.]&#xA;&#xA;If it was any other company,
                I would think about it. A job is a staple source of income, and - depending on the company - could
                involve doing something important, but I have zero faith in Twitter.&#xA;&#xA;Does this all mean that I
                finally get to live out my serif Twitter dream?&#xA;&#xA;Yes, I suppose on your own instance, you could
                change the stylesheet...&#xA;&#xA;So if I set up my own instance and started charging for its use, I&#39;d
                be in the clear, legally?&#xA;&#xA;Yes, that&#39;s okay. The code is licensed under AGPL version three,
                which I picked because other projects in the same space are using it. The difference between AGPL and
                GPL is that [the former] forces you to contribute back to the appstream code repository if you make any
                breaking changes.&#xA;&#xA;For example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP for its chat
                protocol, which meant that Facebook and Google Talk users could connect to it, too. However, the company
                progressively locked down the platform over time, leaving virtually nothing visible that was unique to
                XMPP in its current iteration.&#xA;&#xA;To prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind
                locks, and stripping out the federation part to make Twitter II, I&#39;m using this license.&#xA;&#xA;The
                thing to remember about free software is that &#39;free&#39; means freedom of the user, not that it&#39;s
                zero cost. It&#39;s perfectly fine to charge for free software because developers need to live, too.&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;ve
                seen a lot of multilingual &#39;tooting&#39; these past few weeks. Can we expect an in-app translate
                function like Twitter&#39;s on Mastodon?&#xA;&#xA;I don&#39;t think I could put in a &#39;translate this
                toot&#39; button because APIs from Google and Bing are quite expensive at scale. I&#39;m not 100%
                promising this, but I can probably put something in where people can select which language they post in,
                and then just filter the timelines. That would at least solve the problem of being confronted with lots
                of French posts, without knowing any French.&#xA;&#xA;The only complaint about Twitter I remember that
                hasn&#39;t already been addressed here is the capability of editable &#39;toots.&#39; Is that a
                possibility?&#xA;&#xA;That won&#39;t happen. There&#39;s actually a good reason why they don&#39;t do
                that. It&#39;s simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share
                it, link it from other places, and then suddenly, it says &#39;Heil Hitler,&#39; or something.&#xA;&#xA;Mastotile&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s
                a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter and Mastodon are interchangeable entities.
                They exist in separate ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both continue to do so for a very
                long time.&#xA;&#xA;That said, the fundamental user interface design and current cross-community user
                saturation do warrant comparisons between their functions. More likely than not, you&#39;ll create a
                Mastodon account because a link found you on Twitter, use it because you prefer its type of ecosystem,
                and you&#39;ll stay after realizing that nearly all of your age-old qualms have been addressed, if not
                already rectified. While FOSS and Federated may seem at times like jejune ideologies, their advantages
                are especially tangible in this context. Should you find yourself needing to complain about something,
                you&#39;ll find an audience. Perhaps it&#39;ll be your command line.&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s nothing but
                negligent to describe Mastodon as an alternative or clone. &#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s more like Twitter&#39;s
                son.&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible &amp; democratized, and less
                corrupt. Though I didn&#39;t ask its creator what he intended to gain from all his effort, I think his
                commitment itself denotes a preoccupation with progress. Those of you who&#39;ve been let down by the
                tools you&#39;ve been given to control your words&#39; exposure will find startling competence in your
                ability to determine per-toot privacy, or reserve your raucous photos and terrible memes from followers
                who are not necessarily complicit consumers. Naturally, it&#39;s also much less dependable, though a
                single instance outage will never leave you truly, completely silent. And the support will come.&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s
                been a privilege to be observer and participant in the first lightening of a new online community. In
                the moment, we enjoy our lavender haze -when the spaces are filling primarily with users who are
                sincerely interested enough in discourse to have sought it out.&#xA;&#xA;Sarah Jeong&#39;s account of
                her Twitter exile is a good, long read if you&#39;re craving more specifics, and Eugen&#39;s Medium
                offers a more complete explanation of federation and its place in the industry, straight from the
                source. Apparently, he&#39;s just as articulate with words as he is with code.&#xA;&#xA;If I had to
                hazard a guess, I&#39;d bet it&#39;s not the last we&#39;ll hear from him.&#xA;&#xA;#software #media]]&gt;

                    Eugen Rochko has spent this year perfecting federated social media in Mastodon – his open source
                    project. We spoke to him just hours before it became a global tech conversation.</h2>


                <p>The saga of Twitter, Inc. has been rejuvenated in 2017 by Tump&#39;s antics, corporate drama, and an
                    amalgam of user and non-user disquiet with its decisions, though its financial viability has been in
                    prominent industry conversation for half a decade. Since its pre-2010 outset, many &#39;a&#39;
                    feature has accumulated on its original, still-iconic skeletal software, and – though the net is
                    undoubtedly positive – a few have gone.</p>

                <p>Last Thursday, the company revised in bravado its poultrian default profile picture and its system of
                    replies to exclude @s on all of Twitter&#39;s proprietary services, drastically changing two of its
                    visual mainstays, and prodding a particularly lucent cacophony. Turn your ear, and you&#39;ll hear
                    many familiar terms in the chants: <em>limits, chains, strings, harassment, feedback, gamergate,
                        nazis, etc.</em></p>

                <p>These conversations are important, but they&#39;ve gotten awfully stale.</p>

                <p>If you listen a bit more carefully, you&#39;ll intercept a new one:</p>

                <p><em>Mastodon</em>.</p>

                <p>It&#39;s the open source brainchild of Eugen Rochko, who&#39;s known colloquially as <a
                        href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron">Gargron</a>.</p>

                <p>He&#39;s had one hell of a week.</p>

                <p>Between the night of our first emails and our conversation, his flagship <a
                        href="http://mastodon.social/">mastadon.social</a> instance had doubled in users. Less than two
                    hours after we said our goodbyes, his name was on <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s front page.</p>

                <p>Despite the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just after breakfast on Tuesday to
                    discuss himself and the story behind the project, while the most significant day of his life was
                    building around him.</p>

                <p>“I&#39;m perfectly fine with being called <em>Eugene</em> by Americans.”</p>

                <p>Though the ink&#39;s still fresh on his compsci diploma, he&#39;s clearly prepared for the American
                    press.</p>

                <hr/>

                <p><strong>What&#39;s the story behind the project? Do you remember the specific moment when you decided
                    to do this?</strong></p>

                <p>Many years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated networks when they were a new thing.
                    That was when <a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a> was first created – at the very beginning of
                    my developer knowledge and career.</p>

                <p>A good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have framed it as an alternative to
                    Twitter, which early Masto adopters refer to as “Hellbird,” or “the bird website.” Eugen isn&#39;t
                    afraid to acknowledge his investment in the format.</p>

                <p>I was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn&#39;t happy with where Twitter was going, so I decided to check
                    on how the federated stuff was doing in the meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought I
                    could contribute.</p>

                <p>He began building on his own, with Tweetdeck&#39;s standard in mind.</p>

                <blockquote><p>I thought &#39;if I&#39;m going to do something, it needs to have realtime updates and it
                    needs to have columns.&#39; I started with a bare-bones prototype while still [at University] in May
                    or April of last year. It had no user interface, only an API that I was using from the command line.
                    And I thought &#39;okay, it works. that&#39;s great.&#39; Then, exams came.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Academics had to come before the project at first, but it soon supplied an ample post-graduation
                    diversion. He focused his energy on building something more complete and eventually launched a <a
                            href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=619786">Patreon page</a>.</p>

                <blockquote><p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13303346">announced</a> it on HackerNews,
                    and that was the first public release of the project. That&#39;s when I got my first users who weren&#39;t
                    my friends, and some who were new to federated networks.</p></blockquote>

                <p>That was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his first feedback.</p>

                <blockquote><p>I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the project a bit differently.
                    People were a lot more focused on privacy features than I thought they would be, although in
                    retrospect, it makes sense. The previous [federated] project – GNU social – did not really have a
                    focus on privacy features, or anything built in by default.</p></blockquote>

                <p>It compelled him to change things, and his work was well received.</p>

                <blockquote><p>Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new users came when it went viral
                    in certain circles. The first was HackerNews and Product Hunt. <a href="https://twitter.com/aral">Aral
                        Balkan</a> – a Twitter user with over 30,000 followers – picked up the project, gave it a shout
                    out, and even did a giveaway of his app. He had a lot of followers from Holland; the Mastodon
                    timelines became mostly Dutch.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Next was Marxist anime Twitter (including <em><a
                        href="http://mastodon.social/@extratone">Extratone</a></em> and <a
                        href="http://bit.ly/dbmastodon">I</a>.)</p>

                <p>Lots of furries; lots of LGBT people. That&#39;s when I really focused on privacy features and making
                    sure all blocks worked because these individuals needed a safer platform than Twitter could
                    offer.</p>

                <p><em>Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.</em></p>

                <p>“As you can see, the first bump is HackerNews, the second is Aral Balkan, and then anime/Marxist
                    Twitter.”</p>

                <p>And the last – now a bit out of date – is this week&#39;s spike, which is nearly double all previous
                    waves.</p>

                <p><strong>Are you responsible for all of the code?</strong></p>

                <p>You can look at the <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon">GitHub page</a> to see a specific
                    breakdown of who contributed and how many lines of code, each. You&#39;ll see I&#39;m at the top by
                    a large margin, but there are [additional] people who&#39;ve contributed interesting, good features
                    &amp; fixes, localizations, user guides, and documentation.</p>

                <p><strong>What&#39;s the story behind the name?</strong></p>

                <p>It&#39;s not particularly interesting. I&#39;m a progressive metal fan, and I listen to
                    <em>Mastodon</em> sometimes. They have a really cool name that refers to a really cool animal. It&#39;s
                    a fluffy elephant! What&#39;s not to love?</p>

                <p>It&#39;s also the inspiration for Mastodon&#39;s mascot, which was penned by Rochko&#39;s YouTuber
                    friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dopatwo">Dopatwo</a> after he realized how urgently he
                    required an error page.</p>

                <p><strong>What does “federated” mean to you?</strong></p>

                <p>The biggest problem with this term is that it&#39;s new for lots of people. People who&#39;ve come
                    across federated networks in the past <em>instantly</em> understand what it means and how it works,
                    and people who are new to the concept have a lot of trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first
                    started, people didn&#39;t understand what &#39;retweeting&#39; meant, so it&#39;s not a unique
                    problem domain.</p>

                <p>I don&#39;t know where it comes from – maybe BitTorrent – but people seem to think that when
                    something is &#39;decentralized,&#39; everybody gets the same thing; that it&#39;s all synchronized
                    one to one. In actuality, &#39;federated&#39; means that people in different instances can
                    <em>talk</em> to each other, but the <em>content</em> is different depending on the users there,
                    what they do, and who they follow.</p>

                <p>Though instances are infrastructurally independent, they can communicate with one another. On a user
                    level, timelines are still determined by who you do and do not follow across the entirety of all
                    instances.</p>

                <p><strong>What if Twitter comes to you in the near future with a job offer?</strong></p>

                <p>[Rochko laughs.]</p>

                <p>If it was any other company, I would think about it. A job is a staple source of income, and –
                    depending on the company – could involve doing something important, but I have zero faith in
                    Twitter.</p>

                <p><strong>Does this all mean that I finally get to live out my serif Twitter dream?</strong></p>

                <p>Yes, I suppose on your own instance, you could change the stylesheet...</p>

                <p><strong>So if I set up my own instance and started charging for its use, I&#39;d be in the clear,
                    legally?</strong></p>

                <p>Yes, that&#39;s okay. The code is licensed under <a
                        href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL</a> version three, which I picked because
                    other projects in the same space are using it. The difference between AGPL and GPL is that [the
                    former] forces you to contribute back to the appstream code repository if you make any breaking
                    changes.</p>

                <p>For example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP for its chat protocol, which meant
                    that Facebook and Google Talk users could connect to it, too. However, the company progressively
                    locked down the platform over time, leaving virtually nothing visible that was unique to XMPP in its
                    current iteration.</p>

                <p>To prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind locks, and stripping out the federation
                    part to make Twitter II, I&#39;m using this license.</p>

                <p>The thing to remember about free software is that &#39;free&#39; means <em>freedom of the user,</em>
                    not that it&#39;s zero cost. It&#39;s perfectly fine to charge for free software because developers
                    need to live, too.</p>

                <p><strong>I&#39;ve seen a lot of multilingual &#39;tooting&#39; these past few weeks. Can we expect an
                    in-app translate function like Twitter&#39;s on Mastodon?</strong></p>

                <p>I don&#39;t think I could put in a &#39;translate this toot&#39; button because APIs from Google and
                    Bing are quite expensive at scale. I&#39;m not 100% promising this, but I can probably put something
                    in where people can select which language they post in, and then just filter the timelines. That
                    would at least solve the problem of being confronted with lots of French posts, without knowing any
                    French.</p>

                <p><strong>The only complaint about Twitter I remember that hasn&#39;t already been addressed here is
                    the capability of editable &#39;toots.&#39; Is that a possibility?</strong></p>

                <p>That won&#39;t happen. There&#39;s actually a good reason why they don&#39;t do that. It&#39;s simply
                    because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it from
                    other places, and then suddenly, it says &#39;Heil Hitler,&#39; or something.</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/jrP0kLj.png" alt="Mastotile"/></p>

                <p>It&#39;s a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter and Mastodon are
                    interchangeable entities. They exist in separate ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both
                    continue to do so for a very long time.</p>

                <p>That said, the fundamental user interface design and current cross-community user saturation
                    <em>do</em> warrant comparisons between their functions. More likely than not, you&#39;ll create a
                    Mastodon account because a link found you on Twitter, use it because you prefer its type of
                    ecosystem, and you&#39;ll stay after realizing that nearly all of your age-old qualms have been
                    addressed, if not already rectified. While <em>FOSS</em> and <em>Federated</em> may seem at times
                    like jejune ideologies, their advantages are especially tangible in this context. Should you find
                    yourself needing to complain about something, you&#39;ll find an audience. Perhaps it&#39;ll be your
                    command line.</p>

                <p>It&#39;s nothing but negligent to describe Mastodon as an <em>alternative</em> or <em>clone</em>.</p>

                <p>It&#39;s more like Twitter&#39;s son.</p>

                <p>It&#39;s leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible &amp; democratized, and less corrupt. Though I
                    didn&#39;t ask its creator what he intended to gain from all his effort, I think his commitment
                    itself denotes a preoccupation with progress. Those of you who&#39;ve been let down by the tools you&#39;ve
                    been given to control your words&#39; exposure will find startling competence in your ability to
                    determine per-toot privacy, or reserve your raucous photos and terrible memes from followers who are
                    not necessarily complicit consumers. Naturally, it&#39;s also much less dependable, though a single
                    instance outage will never leave you truly, completely silent. And the support will come.</p>

                <p>It&#39;s been a privilege to be observer and participant in the first lightening of a new online
                    community. In the moment, we enjoy our lavender haze -when the spaces are filling primarily with
                    users who are sincerely interested enough in discourse to have sought it out.</p>

                <p>Sarah Jeong&#39;s <a
                        href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it">account</a>
                    of her Twitter exile is a good, long read if you&#39;re craving more specifics, and Eugen&#39;s <a
                            href="https://medium.com/@Gargron">Medium</a> offers a more complete explanation of
                    federation and its place in the industry, straight from the source. Apparently, he&#39;s just as
                    articulate with words as he is with code.</p>

                <p>If I had to hazard a guess, I&#39;d bet it&#39;s <a
                        href="https://usesthis.com/interviews/eugen.rochko/">not the last we&#39;ll hear from him</a>.

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[The following was sent as part of a personal TinyLetter I&#39;ve just begun in the
                hopes of rejuvenating my ability to tell stories.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;There are a few entities
                which continue to validate what I&#39;m pursuing, but Joshua Topolsky and his The Outline are
                particularly worth noting. In search of reassurance, I listened to a podcast he appeared on in February,
                last night, and also found one from 2013, when he was still EiC of The Verge. Basically the entirety of
                the first is within the idealism I&#39;ve risked most of myself for, in case you&#39;re curious. I&#39;ve
                looked up to Topolsky in a huge way, this past year. He has done – and is doing – many things which I am
                intrinsically drawn to earn for my legacy, and the presence of his wife on his staff (their few podcasts
                together are adorable in a very particular way,) is idyllic in appearance, at least. I love the way they
                talk about each other. I suppose spousal editorial staff is probably the personal hell of a good many
                people. Perhaps, it&#39;s even my own. Listening to him talk on Digiday, though, reminded me – along
                with a few other works I&#39;ve consumed lately – that technically, Extratone is a business. Or at
                least... That it must become one eventually or die forever. While trying to explain my future plans to a
                friend, I inadvertently layed out some &#39;steps for growth.&#39;&#xA;&#xA; Form and activate the
                community.&#xA; Build a beautiful, one-of-a-kind method of content delivery.&#xA; Attain a fairly
                dependable content cadence.&#xA; Sell the product in a way that immediately and – from then on –
                consistently ensures and/or furthers its quality.&#xA;&#xA;I guess we&#39;re somewhere between 2 and 3
                right now. I&#39;m still building a body of written work more or less on my own, which is okay,
                considering that nobody is paid. I suppose it&#39;d be most desirable – before I move to the Northwest –
                to figure out how to make The Tone as much of a learning experience for my closest staff as possible.
                And regardless of all other external goals of the magazine, I think it is more than safe to say that I&#39;ve
                learned more in the past 10 months from a fucking WordPress website than I would&#39;ve if I&#39;d spent
                that time at the Journalism school. The first annual renewal payment for extratone dot com just went
                through, actually. A year ago, I was much more entertaining, but virtually directionless. I honestly can&#39;t
                tell if I feel any better internally, day-to-day, but I know I am at least attaining the capability of
                real friendship for the first time in my life, and I suppose that&#39;s more than worth losing virtually
                all of my engagement on Twitter.&#xA;&#xA;Perhaps its even worth losing a portion of the freshness in my
                perspective – the stuff I thought made it worth it in the first place. Especially if my staff maintains
                it healthily within their own.&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;ll admit that – in retrospect, after spending a year
                reading, writing, and digitally fussing – a lot of my original content smells like edgy nonsense. Some
                of the work within our network does too, honestly, but it&#39;s usually much less so.&#xA;&#xA;Of
                course, that transition required an excruciating crucible, for me, but that&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m
                incessantly compelled to make as much use of my trauma as possible: so that my friends and staff may be
                able make progress toward more fulfilling lives without such a massive up-front cost.&#xA;&#xA;As I was
                writing my interview with mastodon&#39;s creator, I kept an eye out for related coverage, and eventually
                saw what PCMag did, and it&#39;s unwanted rant-spuringly aggravating language.&#xA;&#xA;For most of my
                adult life, I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why publications like PCMag feel it necessary to belittle
                their audience and their subjects to such a degree. Silicon Alley can&#39;t possibly be that vapid as to
                nix all soul in any story, ever.&#xA;&#xA;uh&#xA;I mean… What in the hell is this, even?&#xA;&#xA;I
                haven&#39;t been a reader since I used to loiter in Barnes &amp; Noble with a pile of print editions in
                the oughts, but this sort of layout has got to be some kind of digital sin.&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;m not going
                to bother digging through the publication to compare this work with others for the moment. Perhaps one
                day, I&#39;ll feel the need to polish this rant into an argument and make it more visible. Surely,
                though, the proximity of this abomination to the word Mag or even Magazine must keep somebody awake at
                night.&#xA;&#xA;That&#39;s not to say it doesn&#39;t take some sort of discipline. I doubt I could write
                in this way without hulking hyper-deliberately over wherever the fuck this dialect comes from. I think
                it&#39;s almost certainly more efficient as an informative device than my piece, or Sarah Jeong&#39;s,
                but the assumption that readers would be so disinterested as to hesitate to even commit to complete
                sentences regarding something actually newsworthy for a technology publication should be taken
                personally.&#xA;&#xA;(This is going to echo what Topolsky said in both of those podcasts in big ways,
                but I&#39;ll try to keep it relatively brief.)&#xA;&#xA;I believe there is an audience that is craving
                attention to detail in their stories, a more intimate, longer-lasting, and more invested relationship
                with a much smaller number of publications.&#xA;&#xA;Even a sense of involvement in the process. It&#39;s
                probably a direct result of my longtime consumption of car magazines – most of which still have sizable
                sections dedicated to direct, public correspondence with readers. It&#39;s also cross-platform to a
                surreal degree. Auto journalists of all tiers will straight up engage with you on Twitter. (MotorTrend
                literally prints YouTube comments.)&#xA;&#xA;Sure, the readership is old, and the topic is an outlier
                (it&#39;s fairly common knowledge that &#39;car people&#39; are waaaay more vulnerable to obsession than
                other special interest communities,) but the species is more or less the same, and the results are plain
                as day, any time you care to look. In recently returning my attention to technology journalism, I&#39;ve
                noticed an irritating affront to meta conversation with strangers. My theory is that they&#39;ve been
                paid for their words so long that they develop a very particular greed towards them, which is why
                academic journalism institutes are immediately shunned by their alumni after graduation until they are
                definitely Too Tired to sling copy and begin to climb sortof diagonally through editorial titles until
                they are stashed away in some hole. Then, after ruminating until their first encounter with Actual Death
                – if they&#39;re still interested in the whole thing – they crawl out to be propped up in front of
                moderately sized bodies of petrified students to scream in 100% bitterness about The Ethics that plagued
                them spiritually and financially their entire career at the acolytes as their last joke on the world.&#xA;&#xA;But
                they won&#39;t engage with strangers on Twitter.&#xA;&#xA;As someone who – for better or worse – chose
                to sidestep the academic route, I will never advocate for any value in withholding information –
                especially funny stories – about Extratone&#39;s operation. If anything, rediscovering relevance is a
                wholly meta pillar of our editorial bent. (Hence, why Tim calls us The Nieman Lab of Community College.)&#xA;&#xA;I
                also believe the subscriber &amp; advertising revenue models are directly \- if not primarily \-
                involved in the constriction of conversations regarding a publication&#39;s operation. It&#39;s my goal
                to cultivate a group of subscribers that are directly invested in the product (there&#39;s another new
                word on my part) financially, intellectually, and emotionally. It&#39;s not exactly unheard of, ya know.&#xA;&#xA;Anywho,
                I&#39;m going to leave you in peace for now. I&#39;ve really enjoyed this wanton spewing of conjecture,
                but then... who doesn&#39;t love to go on, unchecked?&#xA;&#xA;Is this what blogging is? It&#39;s
                fucking obnoxious.&#xA;&#xA;Thank you for reading and beware the fucking egg*. &#xA;&#xA;#media #meta]]&gt;

                <p>Of course, that transition required an excruciating crucible, for me, but that&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m
                    incessantly compelled to make as much use of my trauma as possible: so that my friends and staff may
                    be able make progress toward more fulfilling lives without such a massive up-front cost.</p>

                <p>As I was writing my <a href="https://bit.ly/hellbird">interview with mastodon&#39;s creator</a>, I
                    kept an eye out for related coverage, and eventually saw what <em>[PCMag</em>](<a
                            href="http://www.pcmag.com/article/352875/what-is-mastodon-and-will-it-kill-twitter">http://www.pcmag.com/article/352875/what-is-mastodon-and-will-it-kill-twitter</a>)
                    did, and it&#39;s unwanted rant-spuringly aggravating language.</p>

                <p>For most of my adult life, I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why publications like <em>PCMag</em>
                    feel it necessary to belittle their audience <em>and</em> their subjects to such a degree. Silicon
                    Alley can&#39;t possibly be <em>that</em> vapid as to nix all soul in any story, ever.</p>

                <p>

                    <em>I mean… What in the hell is this, even?</em></p>

                <p>I haven&#39;t been a reader since I used to loiter in Barnes &amp; Noble with a pile of print
                    editions in the oughts, but this sort of layout has got to be some kind of <strong>digital
                        sin.</strong></p>

                <p>I&#39;m not going to bother digging through the publication to compare this work with others for the
                    moment. Perhaps one day, I&#39;ll feel the need to polish this rant into an argument and make it
                    more visible. Surely, though, the proximity of this abomination to the word <em>Mag</em> or even
                    <em>Magazine</em> must keep <em>somebody</em> awake at night.</p>

                <p>That&#39;s not to say it doesn&#39;t take some sort of discipline. I doubt I could write in this way
                    without hulking hyper-deliberately over <em>wherever the fuck this dialect comes from.</em> I think
                    it&#39;s almost certainly more efficient as an informative device than my piece, or <a
                            href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en*us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it">Sarah
                        Jeong&#39;s</a>, but the assumption that readers would be so disinterested as to hesitate to
                    even commit to <em>complete sentences</em> regarding something <em>actually</em> newsworthy for a
                    technology publication should be taken personally.</p>

                <p><em>(This is going to echo what Topolsky said in both of those podcasts in big ways, but I&#39;ll try
                    to keep it relatively brief.)</em></p>

                <p><strong>I believe there is an audience that is craving attention to detail in their stories, a more
                    intimate, longer-lasting, and more invested relationship with a much smaller number of
                    publications.</strong></p>

                <p>Even a sense of involvement in the process. It&#39;s probably a direct result of my longtime
                    consumption of car magazines – most of which still have sizable sections dedicated to direct, public
                    correspondence with readers. It&#39;s also cross-platform to a surreal degree. Auto journalists of
                    all tiers will straight up engage with you on Twitter. (<em>MotorTrend</em> literally prints YouTube
                    comments.)</p>

                <p>Sure, the readership is old, and the topic is an outlier (it&#39;s fairly common knowledge that &#39;car
                    people&#39; are waaaay more vulnerable to obsession than other special interest communities,) but
                    the species is more or less the same, and the results are plain as day, any time you care to look.
                    In recently returning my attention to technology journalism, I&#39;ve noticed an irritating affront
                    to meta conversation with strangers. My theory is that they&#39;ve been paid for their words so long
                    that they develop a very particular greed towards them, which is why academic journalism institutes
                    are immediately shunned by their alumni after graduation until they are definitely Too Tired to
                    sling copy and begin to climb sortof diagonally through editorial titles until they are stashed away
                    in some hole. Then, after ruminating until their first encounter with Actual Death – if they&#39;re
                    still interested in the whole thing – they crawl out to be propped up in front of moderately sized
                    bodies of petrified students to scream in 100% bitterness about <em>The Ethics</em> that plagued
                    them spiritually and financially their entire career at the acolytes as their last joke on the
                    world.</p>

                <p>But they won&#39;t engage with strangers on Twitter.</p>

                <p>As someone who – for better or worse – chose to sidestep the academic route, I will never advocate
                    for any value in withholding information – especially funny stories – about <em>Extratone</em>&#39;s
                    operation. If anything, <em>rediscovering relevance</em> is a wholly meta pillar of our editorial
                    bent. (Hence, why Tim calls us <em>The Nieman Lab of Community College.</em>)</p>

                <p>I also believe the subscriber &amp; advertising revenue models are <em>directly</em> - if not <em>primarily</em>
                    - involved in the constriction of conversations regarding a publication&#39;s operation. It&#39;s my
                    goal to cultivate a group of subscribers that are directly invested in the product (there&#39;s
                    another new word on my part) financially, intellectually, and emotionally. It&#39;s not exactly
                    unheard of, ya know.</p>

                <p><em>Anywho</em>, I&#39;m going to leave you in peace for now. I&#39;ve really enjoyed this wanton
                    spewing of conjecture, but then... who doesn&#39;t love to go on, unchecked?</p>

                <p>Is <em>this</em> what blogging is? It&#39;s fucking obnoxious.</p>

                <p>Thank you for reading and <em>beware the fucking egg</em>.</p>
