    <style type="text/css">/* Written in November 2020 by David Blue for bilge.world.

Updated September 14th, 2021 with correct footnote formatting.

`Version 3.1.1` https://github.com/extratone/bilge/releases/tag/3.1

Full, up-to-date source code available at https://github.com/extratone/bilge/

# [The Unlicense, Dave Edition](https://gist.github.com/extratone/140a11428b5dd1dda500b3928e0438b1)

Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the above statement with "words," "writing," "expression," etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

        <p>I was completely unaware of the Tildeverse’s origin story – documented in <a
                href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">a
            Medium post</a> by <em>WIRED</em> Editor-in-Chief, Paul Ford – until this year, somehow, though I knew of
            its existence as far back as 2018. I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment, then, and had
            found myself <em>stuck</em> with Linux for the first time in my adult life. Consequentially, this period of
            my life became my first true introduction to the Command Line – a space about which I knew no more than the
            layest layman. Hopping between my ten-year-old, post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was
            emulating on it (exploring the history of word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say
            a Rite of Computing Passage, obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a
            filesystem with <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and (on DOS) <code>dir</code>. It wasn’t until I came home
            in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells <em>on iOS</em>: <a
                    href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243"><strong>iSH Shell</strong></a> and <a
                    href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438"><strong>a-Shell</strong></a>.</p>

                 alt="iSH Shell and a-Shell"/></p>

        <p>The former is designed to emulate <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> and has just recently
            added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes
            Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like <a
                    href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/">SW-DLT</a> – a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now
            yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually <a href="https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell">a
                fork</a> of our subject app, now called “<a

        <p>Blink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its <a href="https://blink.sh">landing
            page</a> touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge
            experience” experience. On <em>iPad</em>, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of <a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17152482/ipad-pro-web-development-setup-how-to-terminal-apps">Paul
                Miller’s 2018 article for <em>The Verge</em></a> and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “<a

                as my development machine</a>.” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort
            Blink was designed for – “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS
            machine.</p>

        <p>Since I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1421410673049972739">apparently</a> ended up with a
            primary life mission of <em>doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads</em>, I’ve managed
            to find myself <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone">an active member</a> of the Tilde.Town community – a
            place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from <a href="https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136">public
                pages</a> – exclusively through <a href="https://github.com/extratone/jorts">my iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>.
            I’m not the first to use Blink to do this – note <a href="https://tilde.town/~apreche">Apreche</a>’s reply
            to my thread, embedded above – but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my <em>fucking
                phone</em>, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the
            way.</p>

        <p><em>It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired
            Bluetooth keyboard.</em></p>

        <h2 id="locally">Locally</h2>

        <p>First, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing <code>config</code> and/or <code>⌘,</code>. Unfortunately,
            there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available <a
                    href="https://github.com/blinksh/fonts">fonts</a> or <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes">themes</a>
            – you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning/copy-and-pasting the
            url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend <a
                    href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/CLRS.js">CLRS</a>, <a
                    href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/Man%20Page.js">Man Page</a>, and <a
                    href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/MonaLisa.js">MonaLisa</a>, but this Post
            is saturated with <em>too</em> many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list
            any further.</p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155014762-7b8bfc6d-d6df-418a-b43e-6d7aa56582bb.png"
                 alt="Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage"/></p>

        <p>Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively
            with <code>TAB</code>. Where a-Shell has <code>pickFolder</code>, Blink has <code>link-files</code>, which
            does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will
            become visible and accessible in the command line.</p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156869875-93a67975-beb2-4a25-a855-b845514ed8b3.png"

        <p>Linking <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge"><em>The Psalms</em>’ GitHub Repository</a> in <a
                href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807">Working Copy</a> with <code>link-files</code>
            in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line
            evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type
            so distinctly. <code>open</code> also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that
            app’s brilliance.</p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155200832-d2d5fdcb-9538-4f3e-be46-e3b203f28f17.png"
                 alt="BaityYouTubeThumbnail"/></p>

        <p>Some other particularly intriguing standouts include <code>say</code>, which unfortunately does <em>not</em>
            use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. <code>facecam</code> will
            open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded
            above. <code>openurl</code> will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in
            handy. <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I
            probably find more impressive than I should. <code>code</code> is the newest to the bunch and will open a
            local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad – which plenty of positive feedback
            on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings – it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be
            expected, really.</p>

        <p>Blink’s own “<a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/unix-roundup">UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup</a>” does
            an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act
            locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what <code>skstore</code> does. <code>xcall</code> opens
            x-callback-URLs, though I’m <a
                    href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/ta27h9/docs_for_xcall_command">still trying to figure
                out</a> what the command’s options are. <code>ed</code> the ancient command line text editor is
            available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and <code>uptime</code> appears to be actually accurate?
            Being able to run <code>whois</code> locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned
            support of <code>pbcopy</code>. <code>whois bilge.world | pbcopy</code> copies <em>The Psalms</em> domain
            registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.</p>

                 alt="Blink Keyboard Shortcuts"/></p>

        <h3 id="keyboarding">Keyboarding</h3>

        <p>To its credit, I think <a href="https://blink.sh">Blink’s landing page</a> represents the most explicitly
            pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard
            support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the
            screenshot embedded above, <code>Share Selection</code> is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link
            from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and
            <em>only</em> it.</p>

        <p>After a link is selected – which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer
            URLS in a single line – I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with <code>⌥U</code>, then open it in
            Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “<a
                    href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af">O P E N</a>.” Or – in the
            case of a direct link to a file – I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “<a
                    href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3">DOWNLOAD</a>,” which uses
            the <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-contents-of-url/">Get Contents of URL</a> action
            to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in
            handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of
            CAPTCHA requests.</p>

                 alt="Blink Custom Key Presses"/></p>

        <p>An extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with:
            <strong>custom key presses</strong>. In <code>Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses</code>, one can assign any
            text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the
            free version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmopack/id1505218567">GizmoPack</a> to aid myself
            (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded
            above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll
            note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.</p>

        <h2 id="remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh">Remotes with SSH and Mosh</h2>

        <p>If you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than <a
                href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/wiki/getting-started/ssh.html">Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer</a>. I
            screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer <a href="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm">vilmibm</a>
            kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember
            whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as
            intuitive as I’ve seen.</p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png"
                 alt="Blink Autocomplete"/></p>

        <p>One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands
            and hosts” as quoted from <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/whats-new#version-100">its singular mention in the
                docs</a>. There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other
            terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s.
            Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on
            “intelligent auto<em>suggestion</em>” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I
            configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type
            <code>ssh T</code> or <code>mosh T</code> (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and <code>TAB</code>
            to complete the full <code>ssh Tilde.Town</code> or <code>mosh Tilde.Town</code> commands.</p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846342-b9d49f30-61c4-438d-8886-0414951807f6.png"
                 alt="Adding Files App Locations in Blink"/></p>

        <p>Once you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of <a
                href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app">Blink’s Files app integration</a> by adding a location
            at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in
            the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as
            long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.</p>

        <h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>

        <p>The IRC client TildeTown uses is called <a href="https://weechat.org">WeeChat</a> and – especially if it’s
            been as long for you as it had been for me – you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit
            dubitable. I’ve <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/">duplicated the full User Guide</a>
            for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off
            running <code>/buffer 1</code> followed by <code>help</code>. In order to display the chat even remotely
            readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try <code>/help
                bar</code> in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to <code>Fill</code>
            via the menus that appear with a <em>three-finger</em> tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in
            the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific
            commands in a sec.</p>

        <p>Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC <em>On The Go</em>, I’d advise always starting your
            intended chat window with mosh, which – through <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-mosh">a
                whole bunch of alchemy</a> I’m incapable of understanding – establishes a much more flexible sort of
            connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone
            app. Optionally, <a
                    href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink">the <code>geo</code>
                command</a> can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with
            <code>geo track</code>. Additionally, <code>geo current</code> displays a nicely-formatted set of location
            information:[^2]</p>

        <pre><code class="language-json">{
  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,
  “AltitudeRef” : 0,
  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,
  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,
  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,
  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,
  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,
  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,
  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,
  “DOP” : 35
}
</code></pre>

        <p>As you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature – which does, indeed, extend to remote files access
            in the Files app as you move about the world – comes at a significant consumptive power and resource
            sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to
            use the <code>geo</code> command to make <em>ssh</em> connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since
            encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this
            supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.</p>

        <p>If I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app
            in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colloquy-irc-client/id302000478">Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering</a>,
            though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App
            Store anymore and <a href="http://limechat.net/iphone/">its landing page</a> proudly touts support for <em>iOS
                4 multitasking</em>!</p>

        <blockquote><p>Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.</p></blockquote>

        <p>My memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s
            surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible
            solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember
            Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a
            conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally <em>Logged
                In</em> – as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat – was too far out of reach to even be of
            consideration.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that <strong>running
            Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat
            experience as is possible on a handset, today</strong>, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to
            some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable,
            puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual
            conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.</p>

        <h4 id="weechat-configuration">WeeChat Configuration</h4>

        <p>The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though
            in no particular order. As <a href="https://tilde.town/~m455">m455</a> pointed out, <code>fset</code> is the
            tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the
            second option in the list is apparently <code>11</code>, but I fiddled quite a bit to find <code>9</code>
            more optimum.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>fset</code></li>
            <li><code>/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9</code></li>
            <li><code>/bar hide bufflist</code></li>
            <li><code>/bar hide fset</code></li>
            <li><code>/bar hide title</code></li>
            <li><code>/bar hide nicklist</code></li>
            <li><code>/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format &#34;%M&#34;</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you eliminate the value of the very last command (so just “”) and add <code>/bar hide status</code> to the
            list, you’ll end up with a more minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:</p>

        <p>If indeed there is a “reasonable” configuration for command line IRC display on a telephone in the year 2022,
            surely, this is it.</p>

        <p>Due largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean
            droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps
            which <em>usably</em> supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of
            the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone,
            casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s <a
                    href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/televisions-home-theater/televisions/qled-4k-tvs/t-model-line-up-2020">Huge
                Ass Samsung television</a> in ten-eighty pee.[^3]</p>

                 alt="Blink Appearance Settings"/></p>

        <p>If you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut<code>⌘O</code>,
            which <strong>switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display</strong>.
            “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with <code>⇧⌘O</code>,” say <a
                    href="https://docs.blink.sh/basics/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window">the docs</a>. Other
            considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external
            display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with<code>geo track.</code> AirPlay will also cease
            after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a
            feature.</p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158088240-a0f27c3c-1782-4323-bfc5-2c280d3c98e9.png"
                 alt="Notifications in Blink"/></p>

        <h2 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h2>

        <p>Blink has a URL scheme – <code>blinkshell://run?key=[YourKey]&amp;cmd=</code> – but it’s not particularly
            useful, largely because it’s for the moment left <a
                    href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/swzphf/url_scheme_documentation/">without any real
                documentation</a>. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command
            in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates
            with iOS system notifications – as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above – and they <em>do</em> work
            consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any
            useful information. You’ll know that <em>something</em> happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to
            displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last
            time I opened it.</p>

        <p>Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink,
            I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden
            iCloud Drive folders – and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush
            with more Terminal themes – but it’s still worth a heads up.</p>

        <p>Philosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the
            Tildeverse is about – the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only
            with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is <em>all</em> I’ve been met with throughout
            my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this
            shared computer. You can find the sign-up form for TildeTown <a href="https://cgi.tilde.town/users/signup">here</a>

            any application, ever.
            [2] Yes, that is my real location information and yes, I did include it intentionally. Please come kill me
