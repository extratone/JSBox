            <title>How I Maintain a Vocabulary List in Drafts with Terminology</title>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Terminology URL Scheme and Vocabulary Workspace&#xA;&#xA;As I wrote in my app store
                review of Terminology (which is not shown publicly, I’ve since learned,) I prefer it over popular
                dictionary apps like LookUp (which I also have and use regularly) because it allows me to add new terms
                that don’t show up in search results. Somehow, the idea that one might store words that don’t
                necessarily appear in any dictionary seems a foreign one to the creators of LookUp, which I’ve since
                found out to be the cause of its Siri Shortcuts actions failing on me.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1477323450549219328&#xA;&#xA;Terminology
                does support adding “custom” terms, if unintentionally, through its “notes” function. Because it’s
                related to Drafts (they’re from the same creator,) it was quite easy to “integrate” the two in order to
                form the workflow you see demonstrated in the video below.&#xA;&#xA;https://imgur.com/gallery/Q04Kxrg&#xA;&#xA;First,
                I use the Lookup in Terminology action paired with a keyboard shortcut (^⇧D) in Drafts to search a
                selected word in Terminology. There, I “like” the word and - if needed - add a definition via the notes
                button (immediately to the left of the heart in the upper right corner.) I’ve configured a custom button
                - “[Drafts-definition](terminology://x-callback-url/importAction?name=Drafts-definition&amp;shortName=Drafts&amp;description=Send%20term%20and%20full%20Markdown%20definitions%20to%20Drafts&amp;urlTemplate=drafts://create?text%3D%5B%5Bdefinitions%5D%5D%250A%5B%5Bnote%5D%5D&amp;dispatchType=0&#xA;terminology://x-callback-url/importAction?name=Drafts-definition&amp;shortName=Drafts&amp;description=Send%20term%20and%20full%20Markdown%20definitions%20to%20Drafts&amp;urlTemplate=drafts://create?text%3D%5B%5Bdefinitions%5D%5D%250A%5B%5Bnote%5D%5D&amp;dispatchType=0)”
                - (which you should be able to import with that hyperlink) that sends the term including its notes back
                to Drafts with the following configuration:&#xA;&#xA;drafts://create?text=[[definitions]]%0A[[note]]&#xA;&#xA;That
                button results in a new Draft in a specific format, demonstrated by this example:&#xA;&#xA;Antagonistic
                Vocabulary Draft Example&#xA;&#xA;I then manually add the “Vocabulary” tag to the Draft, completing the
                process and placing it within the parameters defined by my Vocabulary workspace, which shows only drafts
                with that tag, sorted alphabetically.&#xA;&#xA;Publication&#xA;&#xA;For the past few weeks, I’ve been
                wreaking havoc on NeoCities’ global activity feed using the action group I created on the /drafts
                directory of davidblue dot wtf. Specifically, the action that uploads HTML files to that directory named
                by the UUID of the draft. (Here’s the corresponding link for this post, for example.) With consequent
                draftopenurls left in the footer of each as per my current, more or less universal HTML template, I’m
                able to immediately open the appropriate draft locally. &#xA;&#xA;Vocabulary Index Shortcut&#xA;&#xA;In
                order to maintain an updated index of the whole list, I’ve created a Siri Shortcut which transforms the
                UUIDs of the drafts in the vocabulary workspace into markdown-formatted hyperlinks of their web-dwelling
                counterparts.&#xA;&#xA;Terminology Favorites List&#xA;&#xA;Even if you’ve no intention of publishing
                your personal vocabulary - or integrating it with Drafts - Terminology is still the dictionary app I’d
                recommend over any others.&#xA;&#xA;#configuration #software #automation]]&gt;

                    paired with a keyboard shortcut (<code>^⇧D</code>) in Drafts to search a selected word in
                    Terminology. There, I “like” the word and – if needed – add a definition via the notes button
                    (immediately to the left of the heart in the upper right corner.) I’ve configured a custom button –
                    “Drafts-definition” – (which you should be able to import with that hyperlink) that sends the term
                    <em>including its notes</em> back to Drafts with the following configuration:</p>

                <pre><code>drafts://create?text=[[definitions]]%0A[[note]]

                <p>That button results in a new Draft in a specific format, demonstrated by this example:</p>

            <title>TildeTown on iPhone with Blink Shell</title>
            <link>
            https://bilge.world/tildetown-iphone-blink-shell?pk_campaign=rss-feed</link>
            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Blink Folder&#xA;&#xA;The ideal means of On The Go participation in The Tildeverse.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio
                controls&#xA;  source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/blink.m4a&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;I was
                completely unaware of the Tildeverse’s origin story - documented in a Medium post by WIRED
                Editor-in-Chief, Paul Ford - until this year, somehow, though I knew of its existence as far back as
                2018. I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment, then, and had found myself stuck with
                Linux for the first time in my adult life. Consequentially, this period of my life became my first true
                introduction to the Command Line - a space about which I knew no more than the layest layman. Hopping
                between my ten-year-old, post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was emulating on it
                (exploring the history of word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say a Rite of
                Computing Passage, obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a filesystem
                with cd, ls, and (on DOS) dir. It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary
                emulated Linux shells on iOS: iSH Shell and a-Shell.&#xA;&#xA;iSH Shell and a-Shell&#xA;&#xA;The former
                is designed to emulate Alpine Linux and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files
                app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it
                to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like SW-DLT - a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp.
                Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually a fork of our subject app, now called “Blink Shell &amp;
                Code” in the App Store.&#xA;&#xA;bbj Out&#xA;&#xA;Blink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal
                for iOS.” Its landing page touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and
                the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On iPad, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes
                of Paul Miller’s 2018 article for The Verge and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “Using the iPad Pro as my
                development machine.” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was
                designed for - “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS machine.&#xA;&#xA;Apreche
                Reply&#xA;&#xA;Since I’ve apparently ended up with a primary life mission of doing stuff on my iPhone
                originally meant to be done on iPads, I’ve managed to find myself an active member of the Tilde.Town
                community - a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from public pages - exclusively through my
                iPhone 12 Pro Max. I’m not the first to use Blink to do this - note Apreche’s reply to my thread,
                embedded above - but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my fucking phone, so I
                thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way. &#xA;&#xA;It’s
                important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired
                Bluetooth keyboard.&#xA;&#xA;Blink Settings&#xA;&#xA;Locally&#xA;&#xA;First, Blink’s settings menu is
                accessed by typing config and/or ⌘,. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection
                of available fonts or themes - you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process
                by learning/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos.
                I especially recommend CLRS, Man Page, and MonaLisa, but this Post is saturated with too many mocked up
                screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.&#xA;&#xA;Local UNIX Commands
                in Blink-ManPage&#xA;&#xA;Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit
                sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with TAB. Where a-Shell has pickFolder, Blink has link-files, which
                does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will
                become visible and accessible in the command line.&#xA;&#xA;Repository Cleaning&#xA;&#xA;Linking The
                Psalms’ GitHub Repository in Working Copy with link-files in Blink had profound results. I was offered a
                brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only
                because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. open also somehow lead to
                swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.&#xA;&#xA;BaityYouTubeThumbnail&#xA;&#xA;Some
                other particularly intriguing standouts include say, which unfortunately does not use your preferred
                Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. facecam will open a manipulatable circle
                of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. openurl will
                instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. pbcopy and pbpaste
                really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. code
                is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly
                useful on iPad - which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human
                beings - it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.&#xA;&#xA;Blink and Code&#xA;&#xA;Blink’s
                own “UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and
                file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what
                skstore does. xcall opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m still trying to figure out what the command’s
                options are. ed the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it,
                and uptime appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run whois locally on iPhone has its uses,
                especially given the aforementioned support of pbcopy. whois bilge.world | pbcopy copies The Psalms
                domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.&#xA;&#xA;Blink Keyboard Shortcuts&#xA;&#xA;Keyboarding&#xA;&#xA;To
                its credit, I think Blink’s landing page represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve
                ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects
                these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded
                above, Share Selection is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If
                I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and only it. &#xA;&#xA;After a link
                is selected - which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a
                single line - I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with ⌥U, then open it in Safari with a Siri
                Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “O P E N.” Or - in the case of a direct link to a file - I could use
                another shortcut of mine just below it, called “DOWNLOAD,” which uses the Get Contents of URL action to
                download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in
                handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string
                of CAPTCHA requests.&#xA;&#xA;Blink Custom Key Presses&#xA;&#xA;An extraordinary feature of Blink’s
                which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: custom key presses. In Config ⇨
                Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard
                shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of GizmoPack to aid myself (and
                you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded
                above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right.
                You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.&#xA;&#xA;Importing
                Keys in Blink Shell&#xA;&#xA;Remotes with SSH and Mosh&#xA;&#xA;If you’re entirely new to SSH as a
                concept, I’ve found no better introduction than Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer. I screwed up my first
                attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer vilmibm kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of
                last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within
                Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen. &#xA;&#xA;Blink
                Autocomplete&#xA;&#xA;One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which
                applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from its singular mention in the docs. There very well
                could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve
                personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish
                to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent autosuggestion”
                without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host
                (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type ssh T or mosh T (ssh keys ==
                mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and TAB to complete the full ssh Tilde.Town or mosh Tilde.Town
                commands.&#xA;&#xA;Adding Files App Locations in Blink&#xA;&#xA;Once you’ve connected to Town, you
                should take advantage of Blink’s Files app integration by adding a location at the bottom of its entry
                in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there,
                all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re
                sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.&#xA;&#xA;Blink File Providers&#xA;&#xA;To
                illustrate, here’s a wee, one-take tutorial on uploading images this way:&#xA;&#xA;Mini Tutorial:

                Chat Fixed&#xA;&#xA;Chat&#xA;&#xA;The IRC client TildeTown uses is called WeeChat and - especially if
                it’s been as long for you as it had been for me - you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a
                bit dubitable. I’ve duplicated the full User Guide for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of
                switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running /buffer 1 followed by help. In order to
                display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer
                list by hiding it. (Try /help bar in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the
                display mode to Fill via the menus that appear with a three-finger tap anywhere on screen. To achieve
                the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to
                those specific commands in a sec.&#xA;&#xA;Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC On The Go,
                I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which - through a whole bunch of alchemy
                I’m incapable of understanding - establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually
                realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, the
                geo command can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with
                geo track. Additionally, geo current displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:&#xA;&#xA;{&#xA;
                “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,&#xA; “AltitudeRef” : 0,&#xA; “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,&#xA; “DateStamp”
                : “2022:03:09”,&#xA; “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,&#xA; “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,&#xA;
                “LongitudeRef” : “W”,&#xA; “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,&#xA; “LatitudeRef” : “N”,&#xA; “DOP” : 35&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;As
                you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature - which does, indeed, extend to remote files
                access in the Files app as you move about the world - comes at a significant consumptive power and
                resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should
                only need to use the geo command to make ssh connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since
                encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this
                supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.&#xA;&#xA;If I remember
                correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in
                Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering, though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s
                iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and its landing page proudly touts support for iOS 4
                multitasking!&#xA;&#xA; Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.&#xA;&#xA;My
                memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s
                surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible
                solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I
                remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could
                maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally
                Logged In - as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat - was too far out of reach to even be of
                consideration. &#xA;&#xA;To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I
                can promise you that running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is
                as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today, for whatever that may be
                worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability
                pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t
                already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.&#xA;&#xA;WeeChat
                Configuration&#xA;&#xA;The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as
                the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As m455 pointed out, fset is the tool that lists
                available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the second
                option in the list is apparently 11, but I fiddled quite a bit to find 9 more optimum.&#xA;&#xA;fset&#xA;/set
                weechat.look.prefixalignmax 9&#xA;/bar hide bufflist&#xA;/bar hide fset&#xA;/bar hide title&#xA;/bar
                hide nicklist&#xA;/set weechat.look.buffertimeformat &#34;%M&#34;&#xA;&#xA;If you eliminate the value of
                the very last command (so just “”) and add /bar hide status to the list, you’ll end up with a more
                minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:&#xA;&#xA;Spacedust Chat Minimal&#xA;&#xA;If indeed there is
                a “reasonable” configuration for command line IRC display on a telephone in the year 2022, surely, this
                is it.&#xA;&#xA;Town TV&#xA;&#xA;Town Television&#xA;&#xA;Due largely to its primary market of
                iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean droplets, significant effort (I assume)
                has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps which usably supports external AirPlay
                displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings
                menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink
                windows to my mom’s Huge Ass Samsung television in ten-eighty pee.&#xA;&#xA;Blink Appearance Settings&#xA;&#xA;If
                you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut⌘O, which
                switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display. “You can also move
                windows between iPad and External Display with ⇧⌘O,” say the docs. Other considerations I’ve discovered
                through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t
                update, even with mosh or withgeo track. AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered
                to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.&#xA;&#xA;Notifications in
                Blink&#xA;&#xA;Other Considerations&#xA;&#xA;Blink has a URL scheme - blinkshell://run?key=YourKey]&amp;cmd=
                - but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left [without any real
                documentation. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in
                Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates
                with iOS system notifications - as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above - and they do work
                consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any
                useful information. You’ll know that something happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to
                displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the
                last time I opened it.&#xA;&#xA;Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all
                the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure
                there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders - and I can’t imagine being anything but
                pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes - but it’s still worth a heads up.&#xA;&#xA;Philosophically,
                one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse
                is about - the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with
                acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is all I’ve been met with throughout my first
                few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared
                computer. You can find the sign-up form for TildeTown here and the corresponding GitHub Issue for this
                post (with a bunch more screenshots) here.&#xA;&#xA;#software #configuration&#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;&#xA;1]
                [Blink’s icon is perhaps my most favorite of any application, ever.&#xA;2] Yes, that is my real location
                information and yes, I did include it intentionally. Please come kill me as soon as possible. Also,
                “DOR” is apparently an acronym for “[Dilution of Precision),” which is a mildly interesting measurement
                to read up on.&#xA;3] As [the screenshots I captured suggest, anyway. Obviously, I do not posess the
                means to test the true resolution display to mine eyes.]]&gt;

                <p>I was completely unaware of the Tildeverse’s origin story – documented in <a
                        href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">a
                    Medium post</a> by <em>WIRED</em> Editor-in-Chief, Paul Ford – until this year, somehow, though I
                    knew of its existence as far back as 2018. I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment,
                    then, and had found myself <em>stuck</em> with Linux for the first time in my adult life.
                    Consequentially, this period of my life became my first true introduction to the Command Line – a
                    space about which I knew no more than the layest layman. Hopping between my ten-year-old,
                    post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was emulating on it (exploring the history of
                    word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say a Rite of Computing Passage,
                    obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a filesystem with
                    <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and (on DOS) <code>dir</code>. It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19
                    that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells <em>on iOS</em>: <a
                            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243"><strong>iSH Shell</strong></a>
                    and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438"><strong>a-Shell</strong></a>.</p>

                <p>The former is designed to emulate <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> and has just
                    recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite
                    extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping
                    shortcuts like <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/">SW-DLT</a> – a sort of frontend for

                <p>First, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing <code>config</code> and/or <code>⌘,</code>.
                    Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available <a
                            href="https://github.com/blinksh/fonts">fonts</a> or <a

                <p>Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed
                    exclusively with <code>TAB</code>. Where a-Shell has <code>pickFolder</code>, Blink has <code>link-files</code>,
                    which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder,
                    which will become visible and accessible in the command line.</p>

                <p>Linking <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge"><em>The Psalms</em>’ GitHub Repository</a> in <a
                        href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807">Working Copy</a> with
                    <code>link-files</code> in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced
                    productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and
                    directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. <code>open</code> also somehow lead to swifter
                    previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.</p>

                <p>Some other particularly intriguing standouts include <code>say</code>, which unfortunately does <em>not</em>
                    use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is.
                    <code>facecam</code> will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as
                    shown in the screenshot embedded above. <code>openurl</code> will instantly open a
                    formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. <code>pbcopy</code> and
                    <code>pbpaste</code> really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more
                    impressive than I should. <code>code</code> is the newest to the bunch and will open a local
                    instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad – which plenty of positive feedback
                    on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings – it is barely usable on iPhone, which is
                    to be expected, really.</p>

                    Roundup</a>” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management
                    commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what
                    <code>skstore</code> does. <code>xcall</code> opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m <a
                            href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/ta27h9/docs_for_xcall_command">still trying
                        to figure out</a> what the command’s options are. <code>ed</code> the ancient command line text
                    editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and <code>uptime</code> appears to be
                    actually accurate? Being able to run <code>whois</code> locally on iPhone has its uses, especially
                    given the aforementioned support of <code>pbcopy</code>. <code>whois bilge.world | pbcopy</code>
                    copies <em>The Psalms</em> domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.</p>

                <h3 id="keyboarding">Keyboarding</h3>

                <p>To its credit, I think <a href="https://blink.sh">Blink’s landing page</a> represents the most
                    explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its
                    Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of
                    shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, <code>Share Selection</code> is by far the one I
                    use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said
                    link will select all of it and <em>only</em> it.</p>

                <p>After a link is selected – which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get
                    longer URLS in a single line – I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with <code>⌥U</code>,
                    then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “<a
                            href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af">O P E N</a>.” Or –
                    in the case of a direct link to a file – I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called
                    “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3">DOWNLOAD</a>,” which
                    uses the <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-contents-of-url/">Get Contents of
                        URL</a> action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a
                    selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but
                    was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.</p>

                         alt="Blink Custom Key Presses"/></p>

                <p>An extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play
                    with: <strong>custom key presses</strong>. In <code>Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses</code>, one
                    can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri
                    Shortcut that requires the free version of <a
                            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmopack/id1505218567">GizmoPack</a> to aid myself (and
                    you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots
                    embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the
                    right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out
                    commands.</p>

                <p>If you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than <a
                        href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/wiki/getting-started/ssh.html">Tilde.Town’s own SSH
                    Primer</a>. I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer <a
                        href="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm">vilmibm</a> kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of
                    last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally
                    within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen.</p>

                <p>
                    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png"
                         alt="Blink Autocomplete"/></p>

                <p>One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both
                    “commands and hosts” as quoted from <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/whats-new#version-100">its
                        singular mention in the docs</a>. There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly
                    long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely
                    like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its
                    autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent auto<em>suggestion</em>” without actually crossing
                    the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name
                    Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type <code>ssh T</code> or <code>mosh T</code>
                    (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and <code>TAB</code> to complete the full
                    <code>ssh Tilde.Town</code> or <code>mosh Tilde.Town</code> commands.</p>

                <p>

                <p>Once you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of <a
                        href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app">Blink’s Files app integration</a> by adding a
                    location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of
                    file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop)
                    will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.</p>

                <h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>

                <p>The IRC client TildeTown uses is called <a href="https://weechat.org">WeeChat</a> and – especially if
                    it’s been as long for you as it had been for me – you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be
                    a bit dubitable. I’ve <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/">duplicated the full
                        User Guide</a> for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my
                    Big Pro hint is to start off running <code>/buffer 1</code> followed by <code>help</code>. In order
                    to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the
                    buffer list by hiding it. (Try <code>/help bar</code> in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom
                    out a bit and set the display mode to <code>Fill</code> via the menus that appear with a <em>three-finger</em>
                    tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to
                    hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.</p>

                <p>Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC <em>On The Go</em>, I’d advise always starting your
                    intended chat window with mosh, which – through <a
                            href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-mosh">a whole bunch of alchemy</a> I’m
                    incapable of understanding – establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually
                    realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally,
                    <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink">the
                        <code>geo</code> command</a> can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine
                    background running state with <code>geo track</code>. Additionally, <code>geo current</code>
                    displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:[^2]</p>

                <pre><code class="language-json">{
  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,
  “AltitudeRef” : 0,
  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,
  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,
  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,
  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,
  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,
  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,
  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,
  “DOP” : 35
}
</code></pre>

                <p>As you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature – which does, indeed, extend to remote files
                    access in the Files app as you move about the world – comes at a significant consumptive power and
                    resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you
                    should only need to use the <code>geo</code> command to make <em>ssh</em> connections persistent,
                    not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore
                    the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around,
                    these days.</p>

                <p>If I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone
                    IRC app in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colloquy-irc-client/id302000478">Colloquy’s iPhone
                        OS offering</a>, though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s
                    iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and <a href="http://limechat.net/iphone/">its
                        landing page</a> proudly touts support for <em>iOS 4 multitasking</em>!</p>

                <blockquote><p>Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.</p></blockquote>

                <p>My memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the
                    era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every
                    possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then
                    my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall,
                    one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining
                    ambiently, eternally <em>Logged In</em> – as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat – was too
                    far out of reach to even be of consideration.</p>

                <p>To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that
                    <strong>running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close
                        to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today</strong>, for whatever that
                    may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious
                    configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of
                    solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header
                    screenshot, above.</p>

                <h4 id="weechat-configuration">WeeChat Configuration</h4>

                <p>The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does,
                    though in no particular order. As <a href="https://tilde.town/~m455">m455</a> pointed out, <code>fset</code>
                    is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The
                    default of the second option in the list is apparently <code>11</code>, but I fiddled quite a bit to
                    find <code>9</code> more optimum.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>fset</code></li>
                    <li><code>/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9</code></li>
                    <li><code>/bar hide bufflist</code></li>
                    <li><code>/bar hide fset</code></li>
                    <li><code>/bar hide title</code></li>
                    <li><code>/bar hide nicklist</code></li>

                <p>Due largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean
                    droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS
                    apps which <em>usably</em> supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can
                    tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my
                    tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s <a

                         alt="Blink Appearance Settings"/></p>

                <p>If you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard
                    shortcut<code>⌘O</code>, which <strong>switches your currently active cursor between the device and
                        the external display</strong>. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with
                    <code>⇧⌘O</code>,” say <a
                            href="https://docs.blink.sh/basics/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window">the
                        docs</a>. Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the
                    phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with<code>geo
                        track.</code> AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if
                    anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.</p>

                <p>

                         alt="Notifications in Blink"/></p>

                <h2 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h2>

                <p>Blink has a URL scheme – <code>blinkshell://run?key=[YourKey]&amp;cmd=</code> – but it’s not
                    particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left <a
                            href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/swzphf/url_scheme_documentation/">without any
                        real documentation</a>. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection
                    as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean.
                    Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications – as exemplified in the screenshot embedded
                    above – and they <em>do</em> work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app,
                    though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that <em>something</em>
                    happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I
                    re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.</p>

                <p>Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in
                    Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation
                    involving hidden iCloud Drive folders – and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised
                    to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes – but it’s still worth a heads up.</p>

                <p>Philosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against
                    everything the Tildeverse is about – the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a
                    few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is
                    <em>all</em> I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post
                    encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer. You can find the sign-up form

            <title>The Fastest Route to Twitter Jail</title>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[TwitterJail&#xA;&#xA;My new Twitter Jail Siri Shortcut marks a milestone in Social
                Foolery.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;I graduated high school in 2012. Back then, TweetDeck was still a
                standalone desktop client that allowed one to post with just the ENTER or return key. I&#39;d made it
                part of the Drywall Prime Directive to generally keep @ihadtopee in Twitter Jail as much as possible,
                which meant pounding my way into it ASAP, daily. This was often my very first task upon returning home
                from school. All memories - much less computing memories - are quite obscured from that era, but I
                wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I was spending a cumulative 45 minutes every school day punishing the fuck
                out of my first flat generation w/keypad Apple Keyboard to TweetDeck in Windows 7.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/TWlTTER_JAIL/status/746295481123274752&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s
                not that automating Tweets wasn&#39;t possible in that era - I&#39;d been posting WHEN IM COMIN DINE IN
                MY FOREIGN AND IM ROLLIN ONE DEEP THAT SHOULD TELL YA BOUT ME across all my social accounts every
                morning at 0610 since Freshman year via IFTT (now IFTTT) - but doing so at any sustained rate required
                actual knowledge. &#xA;&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qyHYslaQx4&#xA;&#xA;Today, even an rube
                like myself can whip up a Siri Shortcut capable of jailing a user account in less than four minutes from
                nill - what appears to be a statically-set rate limit of 310 Tweets in that time. Mind you, we&#39;re
                talking about entirely on-device processing here, and - in case you weren&#39;t aware - the device I&#39;m
                referring to is my fucking cellular phone.&#xA;&#xA;TwitterJailTimeline&#xA;&#xA;Twitter Jail
                technically requires three apps - two of which are ridiculously small, 100% Apple cross-platform, and
                entirely free - and the third represents simply the most refined and delightful means anyone has ever
                interacted with The Bird Site.&#xA;&#xA;Requirements&#xA;&#xA;Actions - Free across all platforms and
                just 3.3mb to download!&#xA;Tweetbot (You might also try Aviary if you absolutely cannot bring yourself
                to pay a subscription fee, ever.) &#xA;Data Jar (More or less optional.)&#xA;&#xA;Upon installation, you&#39;ll
                be asked 1.) to set the default number of repeats (Tweets) per run. Obviously, I&#39;d recommend ~310 to
                optimize your jailing. 2.) To specify which Tweetbot-authenticated user account you&#39;d like to get
                jailed, and 3.) which &#34;key path&#34; (jar) you&#39;d like to store the URLs of said Tweets in. The
                third is almost certainly useless and entirely optional (just delete the Data Jar action,) but... you
                never know when... you might need... those URLs.&#xA;&#xA;Depending on your device (to some extent, I&#39;d
                imagine,) proceeding to run the shortcut shouldn&#39;t take long. It randomly generates 91 characters
                text from a string (which you should also feel empowered to customize/add to,) Tweets them from your
                specified account, and stores the URLs of those Tweets in the jar you may or may not have specified.&#xA;&#xA;You
                might expect me to express envy of any youths reading, but I absolutely feel none. All I can do is
                encourage you to fucking try Mastodon for God&#39;s sake and your own.&#xA;&#xA;Twitter Jail macOS&#xA;&#xA;Update:
                macOS Version Published&#xA;&#xA;I’ve created a macOS version of Twitter Jail which also requires the
                Actions app but substitutes Aviary for Tweetbot given the former’s native Siri Shortcuts action does not
                require the app to open for each Tweet. &#xA;&#xA;1] It&#39;s actually still available from [various
                sources - including the Mac App Store - but has fallen way, way out of support.&#xA;&#xA;#automation

            <title>Using Drafts with NeoCities</title>
            <link>
            https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities?pk_campaign=rss-feed</link>
            <description>&lt;![CDATA[DraftsxNeoCities&#xA;&#xA;A Drafts Action Group for interacting with WebDAV-enabled
                sites.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA;  source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/draftsandneocities.mp3&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;Thanks
                to recent learning, I have managed to manifest one of my alltime fantasy integrations: I have tied
                Drafts and NeoCities together directly via my NeoCities Action Group, which uses Drafts&#39; native
                WebDAV support to (technically) interact with any website based on the protocol. I created it largely to
                interact with NeoCities over iOS, but frankly I was already doing so more effectively than the Action
                Group will ever offer with the iOS app Koder. It’s odd and a bit out of support, but incredibly useful
                and supported all the way back to iOS 9. Unfortunately, many of its functions - like deleting remote
                files, for instance - will result in a crash on modern devices. Also unfortunate - I’m afraid my Action
                Group doesn’t offer solutions to these problems. On iOS, it’s limited in function to pushing files to
                your WebDAV server and then opening them in a web browser. &#xA;&#xA;NeoCitiesActionGroup&#xA;&#xA;It
                wasn&#39;t as simple as HTML encoding the draft] content with percentage signs, either. In order to
                produce [satisfactory results, I had to wrap every output in a very custom HTML template which I would
                very much encourage you to personalize before using (considering especially that it includes my
                personalized footer links and colors.) You can view that template in full here. To be honest, I can’t
                quite recall where I found the original, but it was probably either included with a native Drafts action
                or found among Stephen Millard’s TAD library.&#xA;&#xA;toDraft-UUID&#xA;&#xA;The most reliable means of
                identifying, pushing, and retrieving a draft from a WebDAV site (that I found, anyway,) is by using its
                Universally unique identifier (UUID) in its pathname. An apt example: the draft I’m currently whittling
                on, enumerated 7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E. The action above - Draft to /drafts as UUID.html -
                will push the contents of your current draft to /drafts/the Draft’s UUID.html. (That&#39;s how I created
                the example.) &#xA;&#xA;NeoCitiesActionGroup-Viewedonmacos&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;ve done my best to color code
                the actions based on the potential &#34;severity&#34; of their result, but the way they display will
                depend almost entirely on which particular Drafts theme you&#39;re using at the moment. Nevertheless,
                blue/green indicate the &#34;safest&#34; actions - like the ones that simply open a link to a draft you&#39;ve
                already pushed - and yellow/orange/red actions involve pushing/manipulating files at the root of your
                site.&#xA;&#xA;Below is the full documentation of each of the actions (and the separators, even,)
                including individual install links, though I would very much recommend you install the whole bit. You&#39;ll

                    interacting with WebDAV-enabled sites.</h2>


                <p>
                    <audio controls="">

                    </audio>
                </p>

                <p>Thanks to recent learning, I have managed to manifest one of my alltime fantasy integrations: I have
                    tied Drafts and NeoCities together directly via <a
                            href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1uF"><strong>my NeoCities Action Group</strong></a>,
                    which uses <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#webdav">Drafts&#39;
                        native WebDAV support</a> to (technically) interact with any website based on the protocol. I
                    created it largely to interact with NeoCities over iOS, but frankly I was already doing so more
                    effectively than the Action Group will ever offer with the iOS app <a
                            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/koder-code-editor/id1447489375">Koder</a>. It’s odd and
                    a bit out of support, but incredibly useful and supported all the way back to iOS 9. Unfortunately,
                    many of its functions – like deleting remote files, for instance – will result in a crash on modern
                    devices. Also unfortunate – I’m afraid my Action Group doesn’t offer solutions to these problems. On
                    iOS, it’s limited in function to pushing files to your WebDAV server and then opening them in a web
                    browser.</p>

                <p>
                    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/152169590-518d1043-c02b-49a1-9f19-76699362ab96.png"
                         alt="NeoCitiesActionGroup"/></p>

                <p>It wasn&#39;t as simple as HTML encoding the [draft] content with percentage signs, either. In order
                    to produce <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/A350D578-1CFA-4B5A-8655-74F6B3AD72AE.html">satisfactory
                        results</a>, I had to wrap every output in a very custom HTML template which I would very much
                    encourage you to personalize before using (considering especially that it includes my personalized
                    footer links and <a href="http://bilge.world/colophon">colors</a>.) You can view that template in
                    full <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/8700B562-8716-489A-B554-641549B6B3E5.html">here</a>. To
                    be honest, I can’t quite recall where I found the original, but it was probably either included with
                    a native Drafts action or found among <a href="https://www.thoughtasylum.com/tadpole">Stephen
                        Millard’s TAD library</a>.</p>

                <p>
                    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153755878-5b40147a-040b-4e8f-83ae-ce187d40ec0d.png"

                <p>The most reliable means of identifying, pushing, and retrieving a draft from a WebDAV site (that I
                    found, anyway,) is by using its <a
                            href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Universally unique
                        identifier</a> (UUID) in its pathname. An apt example: <a
                            href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E.html">the draft I’m
                        currently whittling on</a>, enumerated <code>7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E</code>. The
                    action above – <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ve">Draft to /drafts as UUID.html</a> –
                    will push the contents of your current draft to /drafts/<code>the Draft’s UUID</code>.html. (That&#39;s
                    how I created the example.)</p>

                <p>
                    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153760436-80095f77-6d9a-4325-8b09-e871bb812bb2.png"
                         alt="NeoCitiesActionGroup-Viewedonmacos"/></p>

                <p>I&#39;ve done my best to color code the actions based on the potential “severity” of their result,
                    but the way they display will depend almost entirely on which particular <a
                            href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/theme_definitions?order=updated">Drafts theme</a> you&#39;re
                    using at the moment. Nevertheless, blue/green indicate the “safest” actions – like the ones that
                    simply <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1vc">open a link to a draft you&#39;ve already
                        pushed</a> – and yellow/orange/red actions involve <a
                            href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1v9">pushing/manipulating files at the root of your
                        site</a>.</p>

                <p>Below is the full documentation of each of the actions (and the separators, even,) including
                    individual install links, though I would very much recommend you install <a

                there is currently a Write.as desktop application in the works for macOS and the web editor is certainly
                no slouch, I thought I&#39;d attempt to take advantage of my newfound knowledge of the Write.as CLI,
                Drafts Actions, and Siri Shortcuts on macOS to manifest one of my all-time dream integrations:
                publishing directly to write.as with Drafts.&#xA;&#xA;To start - assuming you already have the CLI
                installed - lets run writeas help post in our shell:&#xA;&#xA;WriteasHelpPost&#xA;&#xA;For my own use, I
                really needed to consider just two arguments, here: which blog I&#39;m posting to and in which format.
                Since my blog&#39;s CSS overwrites all but monospace, I always publish in --sans. Keeping this in mind,
                I allotted for these two options in my Siri Shortcut as customizations set on install.&#xA;&#xA;ShortcutSetup&#xA;&#xA;Now,
                whenever it&#39;s run, my shortcut will be running this command: write-as post -c chaff --font sans plus
                whatever input I&#39;ve given it. By default, it will grab from the clipboard, but I&#39;m going to use
                a custom Drafts action to send input, instead.&#xA;&#xA;DraftstoWriteasAction&#xA;&#xA;Very simply, this
                action simply calls a shortcut entitled &#34;Post to Write.as Blog (macOS)&#34; sending the

                    (optionally) Drafts for Mac.</h2>


                <p>Though there is currently a <a href="https://code.as/writeas/macos">Write.as desktop application in

                <p>To start – assuming you already have the CLI installed – lets run <code>writeas help post</code> in
                    our shell:</p>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[TextReplacement&#xA;&#xA;Declare a Personalized Vocabulary across Apple’s OSs with
                Text Replacement.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;If you’re like me, your cumulative experience of typing on
                iPhones for more than a decade is probably saturated with needlessly disruptive, unsolicited, and
                inaccurate autocorrection. Certain proper nouns and a dozen or so quasi-localized dialectal terms in our
                day-to-day writing/speech have been treated by the system&#39;s autocorrect as foreign objects,
                regardless of how frequently we use them. Technically, this isn&#39;t supposed to happen, but - if you&#39;ve
                got the patience and the time - there&#39;s a native feature across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that allows
                you to declare your own user dictionary called Text Replacement.&#xA;&#xA;https://youtube.com/watch?v=4Pu4VCiApMU&#xA;&#xA;You
                can find the Text Replacement menu on iOS - as pictured in the screenshot embedded above - by navigating
                to General ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Text Replacement or (maybe) by tapping this link. If you think you might use it
                often, I&#39;d suggest installing this Siri Shortcut I created that navigates directly to the Text
                Replacement menu. To be honest, I’ve no idea what you’ll find there if you’ve never created a single
                entry and - since there’s no way to import or export from the menu - I’m not willing to delete all of
                mine to find out. &#xA;&#xA;TextReplacementEntry&#xA;&#xA;Tap the plus (+) symbol in the upper right
                hand corner of this menu and you should find yourself on a screen identical to the one shown in the
                screenshot embedded above, with two text entry fields labeled Phrase and Shortcut. To simply define a
                phrase - like “Extratone,” for instance, we needn’t actually use the latter, though I almost always do.
                I would suggest making two entries for those terms that aren’t always lowercase/uppercase - Extratone
                and extratone.&#xA;&#xA;My suggestion: you needn’t waste too much time sitting and noodling over
                potential entries. Instead, try to notice the next time you encounter a frustrating misapplication of
                autocorrect. Add the Siri Shortcut I shared above to your homescreen so that you can quickly access the
                menu in this situation. Adding a single word shouldn’t take you more than a few seconds, this way.&#xA;&#xA;Here’s
                the result of my continuing this practice for the past few years:&#xA;&#xA;https://gist.github.com/extratone/3c7788e41d32958a04a2ab693fe0512c&#xA;&#xA;Text
                Expansion&#xA;&#xA;The goal of this guide was to help those experiencing repeated incorrect autocorrect
                actions, but Text Replacement’s explicit purpose is also worth consideration. Similar in function to a
                favorite third-party app of mine called Text Expander, you can also use Text Replacement to create text
                shortcuts to lengthy/tedious/otherwise difficult to replicate text strings. This includes emojis! As
                you’ll note in the Gist embedded above, my typing out moyai with replace the text “moyai” with “🗿.” In
                order to escape the shortcut and simply print the word “moyai,” all I need to do is tap the esc key on
                my keyboard or the x in the upper right hand corner of the autocorrect object. See this demonstrated in
                my video guide and/or the GIF embedded below:&#xA;&#xA;https://imgur.com/gallery/K3EWBqh&#xA;&#xA;What I
                forgot to mention in the video is that the Text Replacement dictionary is persistent by default across
                iOS, iPadOS, and macOS via iCloud. You’ll find the menu in the last one at System Preferences ⇨ Keyboard
                ⇨ Text.&#xA;&#xA;Text Menu in macOS&#xA;&#xA;From here, you can actually Select All and drag the
                contents of the text menu to Finder, which will result in a file entitled Text Substitutions.plist.
                Technically, this does allow one to back up their Text Replacement configuration, although actually
                restoring said backup would have to be done by hand, term by term.&#xA;&#xA;https://imgur.com/gallery/EeTksyI&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/atnbueno/status/1506348606374170635&#xA;&#xA;a

                <h2 id="text-expansion">Text Expansion</h2>

                <p>The goal of this guide was to help those experiencing repeated incorrect autocorrect actions, but
                    Text Replacement’s explicit purpose is also worth consideration. Similar in function to a favorite
                    third-party app of mine called <a
                            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textexpander-keyboard/id1075927186">Text Expander</a>,
                    you can also use Text Replacement to create text shortcuts to lengthy/tedious/otherwise difficult to
                    replicate text strings. This includes emojis! As you’ll note in the Gist embedded above, my typing
                    out moyai with replace the text “moyai” with “🗿.” In order to escape the shortcut and simply print
                    the word “moyai,” all I need to do is tap the <code>esc</code> key on my keyboard or the
                    <code>x</code> in the upper right hand corner of the autocorrect object. See this demonstrated in <a
                            href="https://youtu.be/4Pu4VCiApMU">my video guide</a> and/or <a
                            href="https://imgur.com/gallery/K3EWBqh">the GIF embedded below</a>:</p>

                <p>What I forgot to mention in the video is that the Text Replacement dictionary is persistent by
                    default across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS via iCloud. You’ll find the menu in the last one at <code>System
                        Preferences ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Text</code>.</p>

                <p>From here, you can actually Select All and drag the contents of the text menu to Finder, which will
                    result in a file entitled <code>Text Substitutions.plist.</code> Technically, this <em>does</em>
                    allow one to back up their Text Replacement configuration, although actually <em>restoring</em> said
                    backup would have to be done by hand, term by term.</p>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[TelegramShortcuts&#xA;&#xA;Shortcuts, bots, and some other methodologies discovered
                since my Big Telegram Post.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA;  source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/TelegramExtras.mp3&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;Since
                I published “I Trust Telegram,” the messenging service has been in the news. Their launch of Sponsored
                Messages predated its publication, but I omitted any mention of them because I’d yet to see any
                meaningful effects on my own use of the service. All I’ll say now: nearly four months of daily use
                later, this is still the case. I’ve published a few Siri Shortcuts and a Drafts action in the interim,
                though, and thought these few additional discoveries worth another Post.&#xA;&#xA;Siri Shortcuts&#xA;&#xA;SeekTelegramMessagebyID&#xA;&#xA;Seek
                Telegram Message by ID&#xA;&#xA;As I noted in the Big Telegram Post, navigating to/referencing specific
                messages in Telegram is ridiculously easy due to its URL format: https://t.me/Channel@]/[Chronological
                Message ID] My Seek Messages by ID shortcut will prompt you to set defaults for both Channel @ and
                message number upon installation. This could be useful for channel/group administrators who need to
                reference/update a message containing community rules, but specifying them is entirely optional.
                Otherwise, the shortcut will prompt you to enter a channel or group’s @ (minus the symbol itself,)
                followed by the numeric ID of the message you’re looking for. It will then copy the complete URL to the
                clipboard and open it in [Telegram Messenger for iOS. I’ve found it handy when joining a new
                channnel/group to quickly indulge my curiosity about its first few messages.&#xA;&#xA;URLListtoTelegram&#xA;&#xA;URL
                List ⇨ Telegram&#xA;&#xA;Effectively, this shortcut allows you to send links to a set of Safari 15 tabs
                to a contact of your choice in Telegram. It’s the singular one of the shortcuts shared in this Post that
                makes use of Telegram Messenger for iOS’ native Siri Shortcuts actions, and is therefore the most
                finnicky. In the first take of my video demo, it timed out trying to send 200+ links to my Saved
                Messages channel, but was successful in the second (the take I published) in sending just four links.
                Upon each run, the shortcut will prompt you to select a contact. The selection must be a phone number,
                ideally in International Format. It will then parse a list of URLs in your clipboard and send them one
                at a time via Telegram’s native action without opening the app.&#xA;&#xA;ClipboardtoTelegramMessage&#xA;&#xA;Clipboard
                ⇨ Telegram Message&#xA;&#xA;This one makes use of Telegram Messenger for iOS’ URL scheme, which isn’t
                really documented properly anywhere. &#xA;&#xA;tg://msg?text=[Content]&amp;to=[TargetPhone#]&#xA;&#xA;Upon
                installation, the shortcut will prompt you to specify a target phone number in International Format. In
                the following runs, the shortcut will open Telegram to the conversation with the phone number you’ve
                specified (use your own phone number to set it to your personal Saved Messages channel) with the
                contents of your clipboard in the text entry field. You’ll need to hit Enter or tap the Send Message
                button to actually send the content.&#xA;&#xA;Other Integrations&#xA;&#xA;Drafts&#xA;&#xA;Users of Agile
                Tortoise’s Drafts for iOS can use my Send Draft to Telegram Saved Messages action to do exactly that.
                &#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1488573937223094275&#xA;&#xA;Like the last Siri Shortcut
                above, the action utilizes Telegram’s URL scheme to send the contents of your current draft to a
                Telegram conversation with a phone number of your choosing. (Remember to change the action’s
                placeholder!) &#xA;&#xA;If you’d like to specify a different conversation, this action published to the
                Action Directory by user maique omits the phone number bit of the URL scheme - tg://msg?=[DraftContent].&#xA;&#xA;TelegramTextExpanderGroup&#xA;&#xA;TextExpander&#xA;&#xA;Group
                and/or channel administrators, especially, might find my public Telegram-specific TextExpander snippet
                group to contain some useful inspiration. .tid, for example, will help you construct a Telegram message
                link by ID just as the first Shortcut in this Post will, while .scheme will replicate the app’s URL
                scheme.&#xA;&#xA;TotandTelegram&#xA;&#xA;Tot&#xA;&#xA;If you happen to have Tot Pocket on your iOS
                device already, I’ve found it a particularly ideal place to compose Telegram messages with formatting
                and hyperlinks considering its similar format limitations. Drafts users can use my Append to 7th Tot Dot
                action to send draft content to the last Dot directly. Some markdown formatting will need to be altered
                - #-headings aren’t supported by either Tot or Telegram, for instance - but formatting can be directly
                carried over to Telegram in Rich Text format by selecting all in Tot and copying, as displayed in the
                screenshots embedded above.&#xA;&#xA;Bots &#xA;&#xA;TelegramRaindropBot&#xA;&#xA;Raindrop.io Bot&#xA;&#xA;As
                far as I’m concerned, @OlegWock’s Raindrop Telegram Bot is an absolute must for any users of the
                Raindrop.io bookmarking service. Not only does it allow one to send Raindrop bookmarks directly to a
                chat when in inline mode (as demonstrated in the above screenshots) - it is also the quickest method of
                saving images, videos, and documents to one’s Unsorted Bookmarks list on an iOS-running device. As I
                mentioned in the Big Post, Telegram’s sharesheet integration remains by far the least discriminate of
                any such integration on iOS.&#xA;&#xA;RoseTelegramBot&#xA;&#xA;Rose&#xA;&#xA;I’ve gone through the
                standard gauntlet of freemium administration bots for my experimental local Telegram group. The one I
                think I’ve settled on, though, is by far the best documented and most inuitive I’ve come across. Miss
                Rose comes conservatively-configured of the box in a sense that one will experience better results than
                its “competitors” in moderating a small group like mine just be leaving the defaults in place. My
                personal favorite functions are /notes - which allows one to save group documents that can be recalled
                with /or # - and /export, which exports the entirety of one’s options (including those notes) as a .txt
                file. (See the rightmost screenshot embedded above.) &#xA;&#xA;Other Insights&#xA;&#xA;video controls&#xA;

                as Task Manager&#xA;&#xA;I had absolutely no idea that Reminders existed in Telegram until a few weeks
                ago. When sending to one’s Saved Messages channel, holding down on the Send Message button will display
                the option to Set a Reminder. Anything that can be sent can be added as a reminder, including - in my
                case - .exe files of programs I’d like to install on my PC later. Frankly, I can’t think of any other
                task management/reminders application that offers this ability - paid or otherwise.&#xA;&#xA;Telegram
                for macOS&#xA;&#xA;The macOS App&#xA;&#xA;A recent update to the Telegram for macOS app has rendered it
                by far the most beautiful way to use the service.&#xA;&#xA;Themes&#xA;&#xA;I’ve spent quite a bit of
                time archiving third-party Telegram themes, lately. Below is a list of installation links to some of my
                favorites which I’ll do my best to keep updated. Otherwise, refer to this Telegraph post or type #themes

                        href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10929">Clipboard ⇨ Telegram Message</a></h3>

                <p>This one makes use of Telegram Messenger for iOS’ URL scheme, which isn’t really documented properly
                    anywhere.</p>

                <p><code>tg://msg?text=[Content]&amp;to=[TargetPhone#]</code></p>

                <p>Upon installation, the shortcut will prompt you to specify a target phone number in International
                    Format. In the following runs, the shortcut will open Telegram to the conversation with the phone
                    number you’ve specified (use your own phone number to set it to your personal Saved Messages
                    channel) with the contents of your clipboard in the text entry field. You’ll need to hit
                    <code>Enter</code> or tap the Send Message button to actually send the content.</p>

                <p>Users of Agile Tortoise’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471">Drafts for
                    iOS</a> can use my <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1u5">Send Draft to Telegram Saved
                    Messages action</a> to do exactly that.</p>

                <p>
                <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">a widdle demo. <a

                </p>

                <p>Like the last Siri Shortcut above, the action utilizes Telegram’s URL scheme to send the contents of
                    your current draft to a Telegram conversation with a phone number of your choosing. (Remember to
                    change the action’s placeholder!)</p>

                <p>If you’d like to specify a different conversation, <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E">this
                    action</a> published to the Action Directory by user maique omits the phone number bit of the URL
                    scheme – <code>tg://msg?=[DraftContent]</code>.</p>

                <p>Group and/or channel administrators, especially, might find my public <a

                    will help you construct a Telegram message link by ID just as the first Shortcut in this Post will,
                    while <code>.scheme</code> will replicate the app’s URL scheme.</p>

                <p>If you happen to have <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191">Tot Pocket</a>
                    on your iOS device already, I’ve found it a particularly ideal place to compose Telegram messages
                    with formatting and hyperlinks considering its similar format limitations. Drafts users can use my
                    <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1uL">Append to 7th Tot Dot action</a> to send draft content
                    to the last Dot directly. Some markdown formatting will need to be altered – #-headings aren’t
                    supported by either Tot or Telegram, for instance – but formatting can be directly carried over to
                    Telegram in Rich Text format by selecting all in Tot and copying, as displayed in the screenshots
                    embedded above.</p>

                <p>As far as I’m concerned, @OlegWock’s <a href="https://github.com/OlegWock/raindrop-telegram-bot">Raindrop
                    Telegram Bot</a> is an absolute must for any users of the Raindrop.io bookmarking service. Not only
                    does it allow one to send Raindrop bookmarks directly to a chat when in inline mode (as demonstrated
                    in the above screenshots) – it is also <em>the</em> quickest method of saving images, videos, and
                    documents to one’s Unsorted Bookmarks list on an iOS-running device. As I <a
                            href="https://hyp.is/bGmFuoOgEeyp5F9tAvJq-w/bilge.world/telegram">mentioned in the Big
                        Post</a>, Telegram’s sharesheet integration remains by far the least discriminate of any such
                    integration on iOS.</p>

                <p>I’ve gone through the standard gauntlet of freemium administration bots for <a
                        href="https://t.me/columbiamo">my experimental local Telegram group</a>. The one I think I’ve
                    settled on, though, is by far the <a href="https://missrose.org/guide/getting-started/adding-rose/">best
                        documented</a> and most inuitive I’ve come across. Miss Rose comes conservatively-configured of
                    the box in a sense that one will experience better results than its “competitors” in moderating a
                    small group like mine just be leaving the defaults in place. My personal favorite functions are
                    <code>/notes</code> – which allows one to save group documents that can be recalled with
                    <code>/</code>or <code>#</code> – and <code>/export</code>, which exports the entirety of one’s
                    options (including those notes) as a .txt file. (See the rightmost screenshot embedded above.)</p>

                    existed in Telegram until a few weeks ago. When sending to one’s Saved Messages channel, holding
                    down on the Send Message button will display the option to <code>Set a Reminder</code>. Anything
                    that can be sent can be added as a reminder, including – in my case – .exe files of programs I’d
                    like to install on my PC later. Frankly, I can’t think of any other task management/reminders
                    application that offers this ability – paid or otherwise.</p>
