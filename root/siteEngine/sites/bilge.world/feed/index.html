<p>As I wrote in <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/appreviews/terminology">my app store review of Terminology</a> (which is not shown publicly, I’ve since learned,) I prefer it over popular dictionary apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448">LookUp</a> (which I also have and use regularly) because it allows me to <em>add new terms</em> that don’t show up in search results.

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859">Terminology</a> <em>does</em> support adding “custom” terms, if unintentionally, through its “notes” function. Because it’s related to Drafts (they’re from the same creator,) it was quite easy to “integrate” the two in order to form the workflow you see demonstrated in <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/165031796-5df78c01-faee-4fd4-84d0-f0bf95fd383f.MOV">the video below</a>.</p>

<p>First, I use the <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1CS">Lookup in Terminology action</a> paired with a keyboard shortcut (<code>^⇧D</code>) in Drafts to search a selected word in Terminology. There, I “like” the word and – if needed – add a definition via the notes button (immediately to the left of the heart in the upper right corner.) I’ve configured a custom button – “Drafts-definition” – (which you should be able to import with that hyperlink) that sends the term <em>including its notes</em> back to Drafts with the following configuration:</p>

<pre><code>drafts://create?text=[[definitions]]%0A[[note]]
</code></pre>

<p>That button results in a new Draft in a specific format, demonstrated by this example:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/K0adnLf5.png" alt="Antagonistic Vocabulary Draft Example"/></p>

<p>I then manually add the “Vocabulary” tag to the Draft, completing the process and placing it within the parameters defined by <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/w/1zN">my Vocabulary workspace</a>, which shows only drafts with that tag, sorted alphabetically.</p>

      <title>TildeTown on iPhone with Blink Shell</title>
      <link>https://bilge.world/tildetown-iphone-blink-shell?pk_campaign=rss-feed</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Blink Folder&#xA;&#xA;The ideal means of On The Go participation in The Tildeverse.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA;  source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/blink.m4a&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;I was completely unaware of the Tildeverse’s origin story - documented in a Medium post by WIRED Editor-in-Chief, Paul Ford - until this year, somehow, though I knew of its existence as far back as 2018. I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment, then, and had found myself stuck with Linux for the first time in my adult life. Consequentially, this period of my life became my first true introduction to the Command Line - a space about which I knew no more than the layest layman. Hopping between my ten-year-old, post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was emulating on it (exploring the history of word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say a Rite of Computing Passage, obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a filesystem with cd, ls, and (on DOS) dir. It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells on iOS: iSH Shell and a-Shell.&#xA;&#xA;iSH Shell and a-Shell&#xA;&#xA;The former is designed to emulate Alpine Linux and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like SW-DLT - a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually a fork of our subject app, now called “Blink Shell &amp; Code” in the App Store.&#xA;&#xA;bbj Out&#xA;&#xA;Blink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its landing page touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On iPad, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of Paul Miller’s 2018 article for The Verge and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “Using the iPad Pro as my development machine.” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was designed for - “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS machine.&#xA;&#xA;Apreche Reply&#xA;&#xA;Since I’ve apparently ended up with a primary life mission of doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads, I’ve managed to find myself an active member of the Tilde.Town community - a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from public pages - exclusively through my iPhone 12 Pro Max. I’m not the first to use Blink to do this - note Apreche’s reply to my thread, embedded above - but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my fucking phone, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way. &#xA;&#xA;It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired Bluetooth keyboard.&#xA;&#xA;Blink Settings&#xA;&#xA;Locally&#xA;&#xA;First, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing config and/or ⌘,. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available fonts or themes - you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend CLRS, Man Page, and MonaLisa, but this Post is saturated with too many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.&#xA;&#xA;Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage&#xA;&#xA;Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with TAB. Where a-Shell has pickFolder, Blink has link-files, which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will become visible and accessible in the command line.&#xA;&#xA;Repository Cleaning&#xA;&#xA;Linking The Psalms’ GitHub Repository in Working Copy with link-files in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. open also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.&#xA;&#xA;BaityYouTubeThumbnail&#xA;&#xA;Some other particularly intriguing standouts include say, which unfortunately does not use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. facecam will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. openurl will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. pbcopy and pbpaste really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. code is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad - which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings - it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.&#xA;&#xA;Blink and Code&#xA;&#xA;Blink’s own “UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what skstore does. xcall opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m still trying to figure out what the command’s options are. ed the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and uptime appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run whois locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned support of pbcopy. whois bilge.world | pbcopy copies The Psalms domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.&#xA;&#xA;Blink Keyboard Shortcuts&#xA;&#xA;Keyboarding&#xA;&#xA;To its credit, I think Blink’s landing page represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, Share Selection is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and only it. &#xA;&#xA;After a link is selected - which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a single line - I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with ⌥U, then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “O P E N.” Or - in the case of a direct link to a file - I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “DOWNLOAD,” which uses the Get Contents of URL action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.&#xA;&#xA;Blink Custom Key Presses&#xA;&#xA;An extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: custom key presses. In Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of GizmoPack to aid myself (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.&#xA;&#xA;Importing Keys in Blink Shell&#xA;&#xA;Remotes with SSH and Mosh&#xA;&#xA;If you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer. I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer vilmibm kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen. &#xA;&#xA;Blink Autocomplete&#xA;&#xA;One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from its singular mention in the docs. There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent autosuggestion” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type ssh T or mosh T (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and TAB to complete the full ssh Tilde.Town or mosh Tilde.Town commands.&#xA;&#xA;Adding Files App Locations in Blink&#xA;&#xA;Once you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of Blink’s Files app integration by adding a location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.&#xA;&#xA;Blink File Providers&#xA;&#xA;To illustrate, here’s a wee, one-take tutorial on uploading images this way:&#xA;&#xA;Mini Tutorial: Uploading images to the Tildeverse with Blink Shell&#xA;&#xA;video controls&#xA;  source src=&#34;https://tilde.town/~extratone/videos/uploadingimageswithblink.MP4&#34;&#xA;/video&#xA;&#xA;Novel Chat Fixed&#xA;&#xA;Chat&#xA;&#xA;The IRC client TildeTown uses is called WeeChat and - especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me - you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve duplicated the full User Guide for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running /buffer 1 followed by help. In order to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try /help bar in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to Fill via the menus that appear with a three-finger tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.&#xA;&#xA;Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC On The Go, I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which - through a whole bunch of alchemy I’m incapable of understanding - establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, the geo command can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with geo track. Additionally, geo current displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:&#xA;&#xA;{&#xA;  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,&#xA;  “AltitudeRef” : 0,&#xA;  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,&#xA;  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,&#xA;  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,&#xA;  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,&#xA;  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,&#xA;  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,&#xA;  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,&#xA;  “DOP” : 35&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;As you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature - which does, indeed, extend to remote files access in the Files app as you move about the world - comes at a significant consumptive power and resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to use the geo command to make ssh connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.&#xA;&#xA;If I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering, though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and its landing page proudly touts support for iOS 4 multitasking!&#xA;&#xA;  Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.&#xA;&#xA;My memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally Logged In - as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat - was too far out of reach to even be of consideration. &#xA;&#xA;To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.&#xA;&#xA;WeeChat Configuration&#xA;&#xA;The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As m455 pointed out, fset is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the second option in the list is apparently 11, but I fiddled quite a bit to find 9 more optimum.&#xA;&#xA;fset&#xA;/set weechat.look.prefixalignmax 9&#xA;/bar hide bufflist&#xA;/bar hide fset&#xA;/bar hide title&#xA;/bar hide nicklist&#xA;/set weechat.look.buffertimeformat &#34;%M&#34;&#xA;&#xA;If you eliminate the value of the very last command (so just “”) and add /bar hide status to the list, you’ll end up with a more minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:&#xA;&#xA;Spacedust Chat Minimal&#xA;&#xA;If indeed there is a “reasonable” configuration for command line IRC display on a telephone in the year 2022, surely, this is it.&#xA;&#xA;Town TV&#xA;&#xA;Town Television&#xA;&#xA;Due largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps which usably supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s Huge Ass Samsung television in ten-eighty pee.&#xA;&#xA;Blink Appearance Settings&#xA;&#xA;If you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut⌘O, which switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with ⇧⌘O,” say the docs. Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or withgeo track. AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.&#xA;&#xA;Notifications in Blink&#xA;&#xA;Other Considerations&#xA;&#xA;Blink has a URL scheme - blinkshell://run?key=YourKey]&amp;cmd= - but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left [without any real documentation. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications - as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above - and they do work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that something happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.&#xA;&#xA;Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders - and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes - but it’s still worth a heads up.&#xA;&#xA;Philosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse is about - the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is all I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer. You can find the sign-up form for TildeTown here and the corresponding GitHub Issue for this post (with a bunch more screenshots) here.&#xA;&#xA;#software #configuration&#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;&#xA;1] [Blink’s icon is perhaps my most favorite of any application, ever.&#xA;2] Yes, that is my real location information and yes, I did include it intentionally. Please come kill me as soon as possible. Also, “DOR” is apparently an acronym for “[Dilution of Precision),” which is a mildly interesting measurement to read up on.&#xA;3] As [the screenshots I captured suggest, anyway. Obviously, I do not posess the means to test the true resolution display to mine eyes.]]&gt;</description>

It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells <em>on iOS</em>: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243"><strong>iSH Shell</strong></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438"><strong>a-Shell</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157366845-a604bd4c-3ea8-46fe-85e6-930adb8ca180.png" alt="iSH Shell and a-Shell"/></p>

<p>The former is designed to emulate <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/">SW-DLT</a> – a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually <a href="https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell">a fork</a> of our subject app, now called “<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-code/id1594898306"><strong>Blink Shell &amp; Code</strong></a>” in the App Store.[^1]</p>

<p>Blink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its <a href="https://blink.sh">landing page</a> touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On <em>iPad</em>, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17152482/ipad-pro-web-development-setup-how-to-terminal-apps">Paul Miller’s 2018 article for <em>The Verge</em></a> and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “<a href="https://arslan.io/2019/01/07/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-development-machine/">Using the iPad Pro as my development machine</a>.” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was designed for – “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS machine.</p>

<p>Since I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1421410673049972739">apparently</a> ended up with a primary life mission of <em>doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads</em>, I’ve managed to find myself <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone">an active member</a> of the Tilde.Town community – a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from <a href="https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136">public pages</a> – exclusively through <a href="https://github.com/extratone/jorts">my iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>. I’m not the first to use Blink to do this – note <a href="https://tilde.town/~apreche">Apreche</a>’s reply to my thread, embedded above – but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my <em>fucking phone</em>, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way.</p>

<p><em>It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired Bluetooth keyboard.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157378620-9fb29373-d49e-4519-b734-8c75caf54dad.png" alt="Blink Settings"/></p>

<h2 id="locally">Locally</h2>

<p>First, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing <code>config</code> and/or <code>⌘,</code>. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/fonts">fonts</a> or <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes">themes</a> – you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/CLRS.js">CLRS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/Man%20Page.js">Man Page</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/MonaLisa.js">MonaLisa</a>, but this Post is saturated with <em>too</em> many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155014762-7b8bfc6d-d6df-418a-b43e-6d7aa56582bb.png" alt="Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage"/></p>

<p>Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with <code>TAB</code>. Where a-Shell has <code>pickFolder</code>, Blink has <code>link-files</code>, which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will become visible and accessible in the command line.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156869875-93a67975-beb2-4a25-a855-b845514ed8b3.png" alt="Repository Cleaning"/></p>

<p>Linking <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge"><em>The Psalms</em>’ GitHub Repository</a> in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807">Working Copy</a> with <code>link-files</code> in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. <code>open</code> also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155200832-d2d5fdcb-9538-4f3e-be46-e3b203f28f17.png" alt="BaityYouTubeThumbnail"/></p>

<p>Some other particularly intriguing standouts include <code>say</code>, which unfortunately does <em>not</em> use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. <code>facecam</code> will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. <code>openurl</code> will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. <code>code</code> is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad – which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings – it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157388631-7668b9d9-22e7-4fef-8c36-1081e213c193.png" alt="Blink and Code"/></p>

<p>Blink’s own “<a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/unix-roundup">UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup</a>” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what <code>skstore</code> does. <code>xcall</code> opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m <a href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/ta27h9/docs_for_xcall_command">still trying to figure out</a> what the command’s options are. <code>ed</code> the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and <code>uptime</code> appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run <code>whois</code> locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned support of <code>pbcopy</code>. <code>whois bilge.world | pbcopy</code> copies <em>The Psalms</em> domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158213859-c477ddb3-dc51-47b2-8e2f-fa0df9b339ad.png" alt="Blink Keyboard Shortcuts"/></p>

<h3 id="keyboarding">Keyboarding</h3>

<p>To its credit, I think <a href="https://blink.sh">Blink’s landing page</a> represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, <code>Share Selection</code> is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and <em>only</em> it.</p>

<p>After a link is selected – which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a single line – I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with <code>⌥U</code>, then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af">O P E N</a>.” Or – in the case of a direct link to a file – I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3">DOWNLOAD</a>,” which uses the <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-contents-of-url/">Get Contents of URL</a> action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158233450-e7a2eec8-1eae-478d-ab7e-35a2dec79e25.png" alt="Blink Custom Key Presses"/></p>

<p>An extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: <strong>custom key presses</strong>. In <code>Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses</code>, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmopack/id1505218567">GizmoPack</a> to aid myself (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846142-4d16aa31-ee99-4ce9-94c5-852765d7d0b7.png" alt="Importing Keys in Blink Shell"/></p>

<h2 id="remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh">Remotes with SSH and Mosh</h2>

<p>If you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/wiki/getting-started/ssh.html">Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer</a>. I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer <a href="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm">vilmibm</a> kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png" alt="Blink Autocomplete"/></p>

<p>One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/whats-new#version-100">its singular mention in the docs</a>. There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent auto<em>suggestion</em>” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type <code>ssh T</code> or <code>mosh T</code> (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and <code>TAB</code> to complete the full <code>ssh Tilde.Town</code> or <code>mosh Tilde.Town</code> commands.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846342-b9d49f30-61c4-438d-8886-0414951807f6.png" alt="Adding Files App Locations in Blink"/></p>

<p>Once you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app">Blink’s Files app integration</a> by adding a location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846662-df10d713-6f54-46d2-8fb9-d1f77d42b14e.png" alt="Blink File Providers"/></p>

<p>To illustrate, here’s a wee, one-take tutorial on uploading images this way:</p>

<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>

<p>The IRC client TildeTown uses is called <a href="https://weechat.org">WeeChat</a> and – especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me – you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/">duplicated the full User Guide</a> for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running <code>/buffer 1</code> followed by <code>help</code>. In order to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try <code>/help bar</code> in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to <code>Fill</code> via the menus that appear with a <em>three-finger</em> tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.</p>

<p>Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC <em>On The Go</em>, I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which – through <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-mosh">a whole bunch of alchemy</a> I’m incapable of understanding – establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink">the <code>geo</code> command</a> can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with <code>geo track</code>. Additionally, <code>geo current</code> displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:[^2]</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,
  “AltitudeRef” : 0,
  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,
  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,
  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,
  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,
  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,
  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,
  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,
  “DOP” : 35
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature – which does, indeed, extend to remote files access in the Files app as you move about the world – comes at a significant consumptive power and resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to use the <code>geo</code> command to make <em>ssh</em> connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colloquy-irc-client/id302000478">Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering</a>, though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and <a href="http://limechat.net/iphone/">its landing page</a> proudly touts support for <em>iOS 4 multitasking</em>!</p>

<blockquote><p>Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.</p></blockquote>

<p>My memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally <em>Logged In</em> – as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat – was too far out of reach to even be of consideration.</p>

<p>To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that <strong>running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today</strong>, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.</p>

<h4 id="weechat-configuration">WeeChat Configuration</h4>

<p>The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As <a href="https://tilde.town/~m455">m455</a> pointed out, <code>fset</code> is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the second option in the list is apparently <code>11</code>, but I fiddled quite a bit to find <code>9</code> more optimum.</p>
<ul><li><code>fset</code></li>
<li><code>/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide bufflist</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide fset</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide title</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide nicklist</code></li>
<li><code>/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format &#34;%M&#34;</code></li></ul>

<p>If you eliminate the value of the very last command (so just “”) and add <code>/bar hide status</code> to the list, you’ll end up with a more minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:</p>

<p><img src="https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/spacedustchatminimal.png" alt="Spacedust Chat Minimal"/></p>

<p>If indeed there is a “reasonable” configuration for command line IRC display on a telephone in the year 2022, surely, this is it.</p>

<h2 id="town-television">Town Television</h2>

<p>Due largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps which <em>usably</em> supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/televisions-home-theater/televisions/qled-4k-tvs/t-model-line-up-2020">Huge Ass Samsung television</a> in ten-eighty pee.[^3]</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157918199-c9007d31-cb39-4e18-9e2d-e10ac3c93974.png" alt="Blink Appearance Settings"/></p>

<p>If you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut<code>⌘O</code>, which <strong>switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display</strong>. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with <code>⇧⌘O</code>,” say <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/basics/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window">the docs</a>. Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with<code>geo track.</code> AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158088240-a0f27c3c-1782-4323-bfc5-2c280d3c98e9.png" alt="Notifications in Blink"/></p>

<h2 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h2>

<p>Blink has a URL scheme – <code>blinkshell://run?key=[YourKey]&amp;cmd=</code> – but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left <a href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/swzphf/url_scheme_documentation/">without any real documentation</a>. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications – as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above – and they <em>do</em> work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that <em>something</em> happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.</p>

<p>Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders – and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes – but it’s still worth a heads up.</p>

<p>Philosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse is about – the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is <em>all</em> I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer. You can find the sign-up form for TildeTown <a href="https://cgi.tilde.town/users/signup">here</a> and the corresponding GitHub Issue for this post (with a bunch more screenshots) <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/307">here</a>.</p>

Using these along with URL-encoded shortcuts titles (for those containing a space,) we can create links that will run shortcuts from anywhere on iOS or macOS as hyperlinks. These days, this is how I run most of my even semi-regular-use shortcuts, largely from my first Dot in Iconfactory’s Tot.&#xA;&#xA;Tot&#xA;&#xA;With a few exceptions, all the links you see in the above screenshot above “Drafts Instrument Panel” are shortcuts run links of the same type. Most of these, I typed out by hand with a TextExpander snippet. Here’s what the mess looks like underneath:&#xA;&#xA;Tot Code&#xA;&#xA;I had a bit of an issue creating the shortcut, itself. Though Shortcuts includes a native URL Encode action, I couldn’t seem to get it to reliably generate URL-encoded shortcuts names, which is why I inserted the Text Case action, instead.&#xA;&#xA;#automation #software #configuration]]&gt;</description>

<p>There seemed to be a bit of confusion regarding a shortcut I posted on RoutineHub a few days ago entitled “<a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11143"><strong>Generate Shortcuts Run Links List</strong></a>,” so I thought I’d attempt to overview how I’ve come to use Shortcuts’ URL scheme as my primary method of calling shortcuts across both iOS and macOS.</p>

<p>The basis of the whole shit is <code>shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=</code> and <code>shortcuts://x-callback-url/run-shortcut?name=</code>. Using these along with URL-encoded shortcuts titles (for those containing a space,) we can create links that will run shortcuts from anywhere on iOS or macOS as hyperlinks. These days, this is how I run most of my even semi-regular-use shortcuts, largely from my first Dot in Iconfactory’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191">Tot</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155801898-e6c74cee-c26a-458c-a915-c3f969c6f3fd.png" alt="Tot"/></p>

<p>With a few exceptions, all the links you see in the above screenshot above “Drafts Instrument Panel” are shortcuts run links of the same type. Most of these, I typed out by hand with <a href="https://app.textexpander.com/public/14093096578d4f40eeea15649f5cefbb">a TextExpander snippet</a>. Here’s what the mess looks like underneath:</p>

<p>I had a bit of an issue creating the shortcut, itself. Though Shortcuts includes a native <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/url-encode/">URL Encode action</a>, I couldn’t seem to get it to reliably generate URL-encoded shortcuts names, which is why I inserted the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1492174677">Text Case</a> action, instead.</p>

      <title>Apple Rag Review</title>

<p>Now that Apple, Incorporated is a textile company, I thought it might be pertinent of me – someone with incredibly filthy hands – to review its first textile product, the Rag. Back in my day, we were taught not to touch the screen. <em>It’s not good for it</em>, they’d say. Now, that’s all we do, and it makes me profoundly uncomfortable. I have used a fleet of microfiber cloths (ashamedly sourced from Amazon until recently) to rigorously scrub away the CRUD that results from my disgusting, gorgeous hands touching anything for any duration. I also use Vinegar-based Windex (which is just vinegar,) which has definitely eroded my 12 Pro Max’s <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251502745">Oleophobic coating</a> away entirely. It smells wonderful, though.</p>

<p>What’s brought me great grief since the Apple Rag’s debut, notably, have been the discussions I’ve heard on Apple-adjacent podcasts like <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected"><em>Connected</em></a>[^1] post-release of the Rag, detailing just how <em>sparsely</em> Touchscreen Pros like Federico Viticci actually clean their Pro Screens. Less than once per week, if I recall correctly. I asked this question <a href="https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/836622115880828961/947175164800565248">in the <em>MacStories</em> Discord</a> to only a single response:</p>

<blockquote><p>Never, really. Sometimes with the side of my hand, but that&#39;s only when I really notice the screen being dirty.</p></blockquote>

<p>I’m assuming silence from the rest of the crowed indicates embarrassment. I clean my 12 Pro Max’s screen once every two hours, bare minimum.</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>I must admit – it took me a bit to understand the correct methodology for the Apple Rag. At first, I was trying to use the Rag like I’ve used other microfiber cloths, but it’s uniquely suited to flat rubbing upon mostly already cleaned glass screens, which makes sense, I suppose. Unlike regular microfiber cloths, its surface does not lend well to liquid cleaning solutions or scrubbing non-glass surfaces. Nor does it to cleaning <em>truly</em> grubby surfaces. As far as I know, it’s not washable – I probably shouldn’t have thrown the packaging away, but I didn’t expect to review it.</p>

      <title>Using Drafts with NeoCities</title>
      <link>https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities?pk_campaign=rss-feed</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[DraftsxNeoCities&#xA;&#xA;A Drafts Action Group for interacting with WebDAV-enabled sites.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA;  source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/draftsandneocities.mp3&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;Thanks to recent learning, I have managed to manifest one of my alltime fantasy integrations: I have tied Drafts and NeoCities together directly via my NeoCities Action Group, which uses Drafts&#39; native WebDAV support to (technically) interact with any website based on the protocol. I created it largely to interact with NeoCities over iOS, but frankly I was already doing so more effectively than the Action Group will ever offer with the iOS app Koder. It’s odd and a bit out of support, but incredibly useful and supported all the way back to iOS 9. Unfortunately, many of its functions - like deleting remote files, for instance - will result in a crash on modern devices. Also unfortunate - I’m afraid my Action Group doesn’t offer solutions to these problems. On iOS, it’s limited in function to pushing files to your WebDAV server and then opening them in a web browser. &#xA;&#xA;NeoCitiesActionGroup&#xA;&#xA;It wasn&#39;t as simple as HTML encoding the draft] content with percentage signs, either. In order to produce [satisfactory results, I had to wrap every output in a very custom HTML template which I would very much encourage you to personalize before using (considering especially that it includes my personalized footer links and colors.) You can view that template in full here. To be honest, I can’t quite recall where I found the original, but it was probably either included with a native Drafts action or found among Stephen Millard’s TAD library.&#xA;&#xA;toDraft-UUID&#xA;&#xA;The most reliable means of identifying, pushing, and retrieving a draft from a WebDAV site (that I found, anyway,) is by using its Universally unique identifier (UUID) in its pathname. An apt example: the draft I’m currently whittling on, enumerated 7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E. The action above - Draft to /drafts as UUID.html - will push the contents of your current draft to /drafts/the Draft’s UUID.html. (That&#39;s how I created the example.) &#xA;&#xA;NeoCitiesActionGroup-Viewedonmacos&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;ve done my best to color code the actions based on the potential &#34;severity&#34; of their result, but the way they display will depend almost entirely on which particular Drafts theme you&#39;re using at the moment. Nevertheless, blue/green indicate the &#34;safest&#34; actions - like the ones that simply open a link to a draft you&#39;ve already pushed - and yellow/orange/red actions involve pushing/manipulating files at the root of your site.&#xA;&#xA;Below is the full documentation of each of the actions (and the separators, even,) including individual install links, though I would very much recommend you install the whole bit. You&#39;ll need to edit each action and replace davidblue.wtf with your own URL(s) unless you&#39;d like to try and attempt my absolutely gargantuan NeoCities password.&#xA;&#xA;NeoCities Action

<p>Thanks to recent learning, I have managed to manifest one of my alltime fantasy integrations: I have tied Drafts and NeoCities together directly via <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1uF"><strong>my NeoCities Action Group</strong></a>, which uses <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#webdav">Drafts&#39; native WebDAV support</a> to (technically) interact with any website based on the protocol. I created it largely to interact with NeoCities over iOS, but frankly I was already doing so more effectively than the Action Group will ever offer with the iOS app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/koder-code-editor/id1447489375">Koder</a>. It’s odd and a bit out of support, but incredibly useful and supported all the way back to iOS 9. Unfortunately, many of its functions – like deleting remote files, for instance – will result in a crash on modern devices. Also unfortunate – I’m afraid my Action Group doesn’t offer solutions to these problems. On iOS, it’s limited in function to pushing files to your WebDAV server and then opening them in a web browser.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/152169590-518d1043-c02b-49a1-9f19-76699362ab96.png" alt="NeoCitiesActionGroup"/></p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t as simple as HTML encoding the [draft] content with percentage signs, either. In order to produce <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/A350D578-1CFA-4B5A-8655-74F6B3AD72AE.html">satisfactory results</a>, I had to wrap every output in a very custom HTML template which I would very much encourage you to personalize before using (considering especially that it includes my personalized footer links and <a href="http://bilge.world/colophon">colors</a>.) You can view that template in full <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/8700B562-8716-489A-B554-641549B6B3E5.html">here</a>. To be honest, I can’t quite recall where I found the original, but it was probably either included with a native Drafts action or found among <a href="https://www.thoughtasylum.com/tadpole">Stephen Millard’s TAD library</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153755878-5b40147a-040b-4e8f-83ae-ce187d40ec0d.png" alt="toDraft-UUID"/></p>

<p>The most reliable means of identifying, pushing, and retrieving a draft from a WebDAV site (that I found, anyway,) is by using its <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Universally unique identifier</a> (UUID) in its pathname. An apt example: <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E.html">the draft I’m currently whittling on</a>, enumerated <code>7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E</code>. The action above – <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ve">Draft to /drafts as UUID.html</a> – will push the contents of your current draft to /drafts/<code>the Draft’s UUID</code>.html. (That&#39;s how I created the example.)</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153760436-80095f77-6d9a-4325-8b09-e871bb812bb2.png" alt="NeoCitiesActionGroup-Viewedonmacos"/></p>

<p>I&#39;ve done my best to color code the actions based on the potential “severity” of their result, but the way they display will depend almost entirely on which particular <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/theme_definitions?order=updated">Drafts theme</a> you&#39;re using at the moment. Nevertheless, blue/green indicate the “safest” actions – like the ones that simply <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1vc">open a link to a draft you&#39;ve already pushed</a> – and yellow/orange/red actions involve <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1v9">pushing/manipulating files at the root of your site</a>.</p>

<p>Below is the full documentation of each of the actions (and the separators, even,) including individual install links, though I would very much recommend you install <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1uF">the whole bit</a>. You&#39;ll need to edit each action and replace <code>davidblue.wtf</code> with your own URL(s) unless you&#39;d like to try and attempt my absolutely gargantuan NeoCities password.</p>

In case you can&#39;t be bothered, it doesn&#39;t take much scrutiny to note that all but one of these entries - the second-latest, debatably - are directly related to the Fucking Apple Phone. Indeed, The Year of our Lord 2021 saw me watch every single one of Apple&#39;s two billion special &#34;live&#34; events in their entirety, all the while marveling... screaming... at the overwhelming volume of completely indiscriminate hype that still pervades the greater vaguely interested in consumer tech online biosphere. I witnessed folks take days off work solely for the sake of these pre-recorded “live” events, listened to pre-show podcast gameshows involving real money bets on what might be discussed/released during said events, and subscribed to two exclusive iOS-related publications: Matthew Cassinelli’s newsletter and Club MacStories.&#xA;&#xA;Tweetbot Folder&#xA;&#xA;Separate the blogroll, I indulged resolutely in a severe App Addiction, published a bunch of Siri Shortcuts, frequented r/Shortcuts more than I ever thought I&#39;d find myself doing so on Read It, subsequently investing more of my time than ever in personal automation on Apple devices, while also becoming most critical of the practice. I first described myself as an &#34;iPhone Poweruser&#34; some four years ago, in a rambly episode of End User immediately following my original discovery of Apple&#39;s absorption of the automation app Workflow and its rebrand of their work into &#34;Siri Shortcuts&#34; in the beta of iOS 12. If indeed this label was ever meaningfully appropriate to self-apply, it certainly should be, now. Before 2021, my knowledge of iOS as a platform was extensive, sure, but notably constrained to user considerations. I was completely unaware of any &#34;dev-facing&#34; interworkings. For instance, I now have a vague understanding of Apple&#39;s late push to change iOS&#39; primary programming language from Objective-C to its own Swift thanks to my &#34;investigation&#34; into why Tweetbot &#34;feels&#34; so different from its contemporaries. As per my commitment to write the missing documentation for Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts support on iPhone, I have even become familiar enough with SwiftUI to identify a given key command&#39;s result in source code.&#xA;&#xA;Editorially&#xA;&#xA;The most significant editorial initiative of the year was my complete rewrite of /About. In the interest of providing a much more succinct and informative logline, I took direct and obvious inspiration from the About document Casey Newton drafted for his newsletter, Platformer. I expected the process to take months on end, but the end product was mostly written in a single sitting. This excerpt is as close to a Statement of Purpose for The Psalms as I&#39;ve ever come: &#xA;&#xA;  ...observing and selectively amplifying the characters, organizations, and stories surrounding the most abrupt, profound, and spectacular communicative renaissance in the history of the human species. Less abstractly, its beat is wholly digital, namely in tools (software, services, and methodologies) and culture (music, film, podcasts, and media) from a distinct lens established at good distance from California.&#xA;&#xA;Also included is a list of important editorial considerations, most of which could be interpreted as complaints about the general state of &#34;technology media&#34; at present. It’s up to you to judge how well I’ve done at keeping them in mind, publicly.&#xA;&#xA;Editorial Considerations List&#xA;&#xA;As I said at the beginning of this Post, I’m going to miss being clever, but it’s become much more important to me to spend my time creating content that first and foremost provides tangible value for real people. I can&#39;t say I could&#39;ve before imagined what a particular challenge composing guides/tutorials/documentation would be as a writing discipline. Frankly, I&#39;m quite terrible at it. On this topic, I think my particular challenge, going forward into 2022, will be to make sure my continued improvement in this area benefits others more than myself as simply another arrow in my writing quiver, if you will.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/HaggardHawks/status/1480865684276064256&#xA;&#xA;One of the far too many projects my todo list accumulated over the year, the &#34;Please Fuck With This License&#34; - my very own public domain-equivalent license - started as a joke, more or less, with the footer text of my very first website: &#34;PLEASE STEAL FROM THIS WEBSITE.&#34; Extrapolating this pubescent sentiment of mine into a minimally-ideological, yet fully-formed intellectual property license has been yet another total departure from my writing comfort zone into the domain of the legal.&#xA;&#xA;  The originator of the matter may be held entirely responsible for consequences upon any being or other distinct matter legally, ethically, morally, spiritually, etc. All forms of correspondence re: the matter to which this document is attached - including feedback, criticism, praise (due and undue,) general bereavement, damnation, condemnation, complaint, advice, advisement, assistance, counsel, guidance, input, recommendation, suggestion assistance, briefing, coaching, mentoring, priming, prompting, teaching, tutoring, caution, alarm, etc. is not only welcome but encouraged as per the core ethos of this document.&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;d like to think the sentiment I&#39;m going for, here, feels entirely complementary to the thoughts I&#39;ve expressed about creative existence, allegorically, in the past year, but I could just be insane.&#xA;&#xA;The Git Bit&#xA;&#xA;Eighteen months ago, I had no idea what Git was. Somehow, in the relatively short interim, I have managed to integrate it into the very foundation of my creative life. Every bit - if not more - of The Psalms substance exists on its GitHub repository. It&#39;s rather disorganized, but then again… so is this blog, and so am I. For instance, I’ve been intending to write a dedicated post on the subject of how I’ve integretated Git into my creative life for more than a year, now. In theory, this means my revisions are tracked via commits, though to be honest, I’ve yet to make much use of them. &#xA;&#xA;On iOS, Working Copy has been absolutely invaluable considering how much writing I’ve done on my phone this year. So too has been Drafts.&#xA;&#xA;Technically&#xA;&#xA;Footnotes have finally been re-implemented! Though they still screw up line spacing. Thanks to changes to the Write.as platform, you can now view The Psalms without any of my CSS if you can’t stand looking at it, but that’d be a shame, in my opinion. Nevertheless, the footer has been amended to include a “Tiny” link at first position. A link to Extratone’s Telegram has replaced the Discord link as per my newfound focus on the former. It’s my hope that the addition of Siri Speech Synthesis at the top of each post might make The Psalms more accessible, even if just for those who find my words too verbose to read.&#xA;&#xA;Going forward, The Psalms will be integrated with the new Discussions platform in the Write.as suite, Remark.as. Here&#39;s a link to my profile.

<p><em>I am not funny anymore</em> feels as though it has finally achieved penultimate meaning as a longtime habitual phrase of mine – as in, I can no longer remember a tangible self without that sentiment always at the ready in a handy intercranial stash. Its significant, I think: the stoutness of my confidence saying it, now, after the year two thousand and twenty-one. The sensation of it has always been most powerful when reading the oldest of my words published, here, but it now has <em>so</em> much more substance. The argument that this general process is the very most natural for my age – the <em>Peak Specialization</em> Period on the general Human Existence roadmap – has been platituded to all fuck, and yet I cling to it newly and with ever-renewed desperation as I have to any and all authentic manifestations of certainty, of late – even the <em>common knowledge</em> sort I still viscerally despise.</p>
