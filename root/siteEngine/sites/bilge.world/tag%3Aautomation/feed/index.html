            <title>How I Maintain a Vocabulary List in Drafts with Terminology</title>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Terminology URL Scheme and Vocabulary Workspace&#xA;&#xA;As I wrote in my app store
                review of Terminology (which is not shown publicly, I’ve since learned,) I prefer it over popular
                dictionary apps like LookUp (which I also have and use regularly) because it allows me to add new terms
                that don’t show up in search results. Somehow, the idea that one might store words that don’t
                necessarily appear in any dictionary seems a foreign one to the creators of LookUp, which I’ve since
                found out to be the cause of its Siri Shortcuts actions failing on me.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1477323450549219328&#xA;&#xA;Terminology
                does support adding “custom” terms, if unintentionally, through its “notes” function. Because it’s
                related to Drafts (they’re from the same creator,) it was quite easy to “integrate” the two in order to
                form the workflow you see demonstrated in the video below.&#xA;&#xA;https://imgur.com/gallery/Q04Kxrg&#xA;&#xA;First,
                I use the Lookup in Terminology action paired with a keyboard shortcut (^⇧D) in Drafts to search a
                selected word in Terminology. There, I “like” the word and - if needed - add a definition via the notes
                button (immediately to the left of the heart in the upper right corner.) I’ve configured a custom button
                - “[Drafts-definition](terminology://x-callback-url/importAction?name=Drafts-definition&amp;shortName=Drafts&amp;description=Send%20term%20and%20full%20Markdown%20definitions%20to%20Drafts&amp;urlTemplate=drafts://create?text%3D%5B%5Bdefinitions%5D%5D%250A%5B%5Bnote%5D%5D&amp;dispatchType=0&#xA;terminology://x-callback-url/importAction?name=Drafts-definition&amp;shortName=Drafts&amp;description=Send%20term%20and%20full%20Markdown%20definitions%20to%20Drafts&amp;urlTemplate=drafts://create?text%3D%5B%5Bdefinitions%5D%5D%250A%5B%5Bnote%5D%5D&amp;dispatchType=0)”
                - (which you should be able to import with that hyperlink) that sends the term including its notes back
                to Drafts with the following configuration:&#xA;&#xA;drafts://create?text=[[definitions]]%0A[[note]]&#xA;&#xA;That
                button results in a new Draft in a specific format, demonstrated by this example:&#xA;&#xA;Antagonistic
                Vocabulary Draft Example&#xA;&#xA;I then manually add the “Vocabulary” tag to the Draft, completing the
                process and placing it within the parameters defined by my Vocabulary workspace, which shows only drafts
                with that tag, sorted alphabetically.&#xA;&#xA;Publication&#xA;&#xA;For the past few weeks, I’ve been
                wreaking havoc on NeoCities’ global activity feed using the action group I created on the /drafts
                directory of davidblue dot wtf. Specifically, the action that uploads HTML files to that directory named
                by the UUID of the draft. (Here’s the corresponding link for this post, for example.) With consequent
                draftopenurls left in the footer of each as per my current, more or less universal HTML template, I’m
                able to immediately open the appropriate draft locally. &#xA;&#xA;Vocabulary Index Shortcut&#xA;&#xA;In
                order to maintain an updated index of the whole list, I’ve created a Siri Shortcut which transforms the
                UUIDs of the drafts in the vocabulary workspace into markdown-formatted hyperlinks of their web-dwelling
                counterparts.&#xA;&#xA;Terminology Favorites List&#xA;&#xA;Even if you’ve no intention of publishing
                your personal vocabulary - or integrating it with Drafts - Terminology is still the dictionary app I’d
                recommend over any others.&#xA;&#xA;#configuration #software #automation]]&gt;

                both iOS and macOS.&#xA;&#xA;The basis of the whole shit is shortcuts://run-shortcut?name= and

                those containing a space,) we can create links that will run shortcuts from anywhere on iOS or macOS as
                hyperlinks. These days, this is how I run most of my even semi-regular-use shortcuts, largely from my
                first Dot in Iconfactory’s Tot.&#xA;&#xA;Tot&#xA;&#xA;With a few exceptions, all the links you see in
                the above screenshot above “Drafts Instrument Panel” are shortcuts run links of the same type. Most of
                these, I typed out by hand with a TextExpander snippet. Here’s what the mess looks like underneath:&#xA;&#xA;Tot

                Foolery.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;I graduated high school in 2012. Back then, TweetDeck was still a
                standalone desktop client that allowed one to post with just the ENTER or return key. I&#39;d made it
                part of the Drywall Prime Directive to generally keep @ihadtopee in Twitter Jail as much as possible,
                which meant pounding my way into it ASAP, daily. This was often my very first task upon returning home
                from school. All memories - much less computing memories - are quite obscured from that era, but I
                wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I was spending a cumulative 45 minutes every school day punishing the fuck
                out of my first flat generation w/keypad Apple Keyboard to TweetDeck in Windows 7.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/TWlTTER_JAIL/status/746295481123274752&#xA;&#xA;It&#39;s

                <p>I graduated high school in 2012. Back then, TweetDeck was still a standalone desktop client[^1] that
                    allowed one to post with just the <code>ENTER</code> or <code>return</code> key. I&#39;d made it
                    part of the <a href="https://iowa.neocities.org">Drywall Prime Directive</a> to generally keep <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/ihadtopee">@ihadtopee</a> in <a
                            href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TwitterJail">Twitter Jail</a> as much
                    as possible, which meant pounding my way into it ASAP, daily. This was often my very first task upon
                    returning home from school. All memories – much less computing memories – are quite obscured from
                    that era, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I was spending a cumulative 45 minutes every school day
                    punishing the fuck out of my first flat generation w/keypad Apple Keyboard to TweetDeck in Windows
                    7.</p>

            <title>Using Drafts with NeoCities</title>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[DraftsxNeoCities&#xA;&#xA;A Drafts Action Group for interacting with WebDAV-enabled
                sites.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA;  source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/draftsandneocities.mp3&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;Thanks
                to recent learning, I have managed to manifest one of my alltime fantasy integrations: I have tied
                Drafts and NeoCities together directly via my NeoCities Action Group, which uses Drafts&#39; native
                WebDAV support to (technically) interact with any website based on the protocol. I created it largely to
                interact with NeoCities over iOS, but frankly I was already doing so more effectively than the Action
                Group will ever offer with the iOS app Koder. It’s odd and a bit out of support, but incredibly useful
                and supported all the way back to iOS 9. Unfortunately, many of its functions - like deleting remote
                files, for instance - will result in a crash on modern devices. Also unfortunate - I’m afraid my Action
                Group doesn’t offer solutions to these problems. On iOS, it’s limited in function to pushing files to
                your WebDAV server and then opening them in a web browser. &#xA;&#xA;NeoCitiesActionGroup&#xA;&#xA;It
                wasn&#39;t as simple as HTML encoding the draft] content with percentage signs, either. In order to
                produce [satisfactory results, I had to wrap every output in a very custom HTML template which I would
                very much encourage you to personalize before using (considering especially that it includes my
                personalized footer links and colors.) You can view that template in full here. To be honest, I can’t
                quite recall where I found the original, but it was probably either included with a native Drafts action
                or found among Stephen Millard’s TAD library.&#xA;&#xA;toDraft-UUID&#xA;&#xA;The most reliable means of
                identifying, pushing, and retrieving a draft from a WebDAV site (that I found, anyway,) is by using its
                Universally unique identifier (UUID) in its pathname. An apt example: the draft I’m currently whittling
                on, enumerated 7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E. The action above - Draft to /drafts as UUID.html -
                will push the contents of your current draft to /drafts/the Draft’s UUID.html. (That&#39;s how I created
                the example.) &#xA;&#xA;NeoCitiesActionGroup-Viewedonmacos&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;ve done my best to color code
                the actions based on the potential &#34;severity&#34; of their result, but the way they display will
                depend almost entirely on which particular Drafts theme you&#39;re using at the moment. Nevertheless,
                blue/green indicate the &#34;safest&#34; actions - like the ones that simply open a link to a draft you&#39;ve
                already pushed - and yellow/orange/red actions involve pushing/manipulating files at the root of your
                site.&#xA;&#xA;Below is the full documentation of each of the actions (and the separators, even,)
                including individual install links, though I would very much recommend you install the whole bit. You&#39;ll
                need to edit each action and replace davidblue.wtf with your own URL(s) unless you&#39;d like to try and
                attempt my absolutely gargantuan NeoCities password.&#xA;&#xA;NeoCities Action Group&#xA;&#xA;Root&#xA;Type:

                    interacting with WebDAV-enabled sites.</h2>


                <p>
                    <audio controls="">

                    </audio>
                </p>

                <p>Thanks to recent learning, I have managed to manifest one of my alltime fantasy integrations: I have
                    tied Drafts and NeoCities together directly via <a
                            href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1uF"><strong>my NeoCities Action Group</strong></a>,
                    which uses <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#webdav">Drafts&#39;
                        native WebDAV support</a> to (technically) interact with any website based on the protocol. I
                    created it largely to interact with NeoCities over iOS, but frankly I was already doing so more
                    effectively than the Action Group will ever offer with the iOS app <a
                            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/koder-code-editor/id1447489375">Koder</a>. It’s odd and
                    a bit out of support, but incredibly useful and supported all the way back to iOS 9. Unfortunately,
                    many of its functions – like deleting remote files, for instance – will result in a crash on modern
                    devices. Also unfortunate – I’m afraid my Action Group doesn’t offer solutions to these problems. On
                    iOS, it’s limited in function to pushing files to your WebDAV server and then opening them in a web
                    browser.</p>

                <p>
                    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/152169590-518d1043-c02b-49a1-9f19-76699362ab96.png"
                         alt="NeoCitiesActionGroup"/></p>

                <p>It wasn&#39;t as simple as HTML encoding the [draft] content with percentage signs, either. In order
                    to produce <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/A350D578-1CFA-4B5A-8655-74F6B3AD72AE.html">satisfactory
                        results</a>, I had to wrap every output in a very custom HTML template which I would very much
                    encourage you to personalize before using (considering especially that it includes my personalized
                    footer links and <a href="http://bilge.world/colophon">colors</a>.) You can view that template in
                    full <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/8700B562-8716-489A-B554-641549B6B3E5.html">here</a>. To
                    be honest, I can’t quite recall where I found the original, but it was probably either included with
                    a native Drafts action or found among <a href="https://www.thoughtasylum.com/tadpole">Stephen
                        Millard’s TAD library</a>.</p>

                <p>
                    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153755878-5b40147a-040b-4e8f-83ae-ce187d40ec0d.png"
                         alt="toDraft-UUID"/></p>

                <p>The most reliable means of identifying, pushing, and retrieving a draft from a WebDAV site (that I
                    found, anyway,) is by using its <a
                            href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Universally unique
                        identifier</a> (UUID) in its pathname. An apt example: <a
                            href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E.html">the draft I’m
                        currently whittling on</a>, enumerated <code>7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E</code>. The
                    action above – <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ve">Draft to /drafts as UUID.html</a> –
                    will push the contents of your current draft to /drafts/<code>the Draft’s UUID</code>.html. (That&#39;s
                    how I created the example.)</p>

                <p>
                    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153760436-80095f77-6d9a-4325-8b09-e871bb812bb2.png"
                         alt="NeoCitiesActionGroup-Viewedonmacos"/></p>

                <p>I&#39;ve done my best to color code the actions based on the potential “severity” of their result,
                    but the way they display will depend almost entirely on which particular <a
                            href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/theme_definitions?order=updated">Drafts theme</a> you&#39;re
                    using at the moment. Nevertheless, blue/green indicate the “safest” actions – like the ones that
                    simply <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1vc">open a link to a draft you&#39;ve already
                        pushed</a> – and yellow/orange/red actions involve <a
                            href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1v9">pushing/manipulating files at the root of your
                        site</a>.</p>

                <p>Below is the full documentation of each of the actions (and the separators, even,) including
                    individual install links, though I would very much recommend you install <a
                            href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1uF">the whole bit</a>. You&#39;ll need to edit each
                    action and replace <code>davidblue.wtf</code> with your own URL(s) unless you&#39;d like to try and
                    attempt my absolutely gargantuan NeoCities password.</p>

                there is currently a Write.as desktop application in the works for macOS and the web editor is certainly
                no slouch, I thought I&#39;d attempt to take advantage of my newfound knowledge of the Write.as CLI,
                Drafts Actions, and Siri Shortcuts on macOS to manifest one of my all-time dream integrations:
                publishing directly to write.as with Drafts.&#xA;&#xA;To start - assuming you already have the CLI
                installed - lets run writeas help post in our shell:&#xA;&#xA;WriteasHelpPost&#xA;&#xA;For my own use, I
                really needed to consider just two arguments, here: which blog I&#39;m posting to and in which format.
                Since my blog&#39;s CSS overwrites all but monospace, I always publish in --sans. Keeping this in mind,
                I allotted for these two options in my Siri Shortcut as customizations set on install.&#xA;&#xA;ShortcutSetup&#xA;&#xA;Now,
                whenever it&#39;s run, my shortcut will be running this command: write-as post -c chaff --font sans plus
                whatever input I&#39;ve given it. By default, it will grab from the clipboard, but I&#39;m going to use
                a custom Drafts action to send input, instead.&#xA;&#xA;DraftstoWriteasAction&#xA;&#xA;Very simply, this
                action simply calls a shortcut entitled &#34;Post to Write.as Blog (macOS)&#34; sending the
                [[safe_title]] of the Draft as the markdown title followed by a space and then the draft&#39;s [[body]].&#xA;&#xA;video

                    A setup for posting to Write.as blogs directly using Siri Shortcuts, the Write.as CLI, and
                    (optionally) Drafts for Mac.</h2>


                <p>Though there is currently a <a href="https://code.as/writeas/macos">Write.as desktop application in
                    the works for macOS</a> and the web editor is certainly no slouch, I thought I&#39;d attempt to take

                    my all-time dream integrations: publishing directly to write.as with <a
                            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248">Drafts</a>.</p>

                <p>To start – assuming you already have the CLI installed – lets run <code>writeas help post</code> in
                    our shell:</p>

                <p>

                         alt="WriteasHelpPost"/></p>

                <p>For my own use, I really needed to consider just two arguments, here: which blog I&#39;m posting to
                    and in which format. Since <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/Custom%20CSS.css">my
                        blog&#39;s CSS</a> overwrites all but <code>monospace</code>, I always publish in

                         alt="ShortcutSetup"/></p>

                <p>Now, whenever it&#39;s run, my shortcut will be running this command: <code>write-as post -c chaff
                    --font sans</code> plus whatever input I&#39;ve given it. By default, it will grab from the

                         alt="DraftstoWriteasAction"/></p>

                <p>Very simply, this action simply calls a shortcut entitled “Post to Write.as Blog (macOS)” sending the
                    <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates#content-tags">[[safe_title]]</a> of the

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[TelegramShortcuts&#xA;&#xA;Shortcuts, bots, and some other methodologies discovered
                since my Big Telegram Post.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA;  source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/TelegramExtras.mp3&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;Since
                I published “I Trust Telegram,” the messenging service has been in the news. Their launch of Sponsored
                Messages predated its publication, but I omitted any mention of them because I’d yet to see any
                meaningful effects on my own use of the service. All I’ll say now: nearly four months of daily use
                later, this is still the case. I’ve published a few Siri Shortcuts and a Drafts action in the interim,
                though, and thought these few additional discoveries worth another Post.&#xA;&#xA;Siri Shortcuts&#xA;&#xA;SeekTelegramMessagebyID&#xA;&#xA;Seek
                Telegram Message by ID&#xA;&#xA;As I noted in the Big Telegram Post, navigating to/referencing specific
                messages in Telegram is ridiculously easy due to its URL format: https://t.me/Channel@]/[Chronological
                Message ID] My Seek Messages by ID shortcut will prompt you to set defaults for both Channel @ and
                message number upon installation. This could be useful for channel/group administrators who need to
                reference/update a message containing community rules, but specifying them is entirely optional.
                Otherwise, the shortcut will prompt you to enter a channel or group’s @ (minus the symbol itself,)
                followed by the numeric ID of the message you’re looking for. It will then copy the complete URL to the
                clipboard and open it in [Telegram Messenger for iOS. I’ve found it handy when joining a new
                channnel/group to quickly indulge my curiosity about its first few messages.&#xA;&#xA;URLListtoTelegram&#xA;&#xA;URL
                List ⇨ Telegram&#xA;&#xA;Effectively, this shortcut allows you to send links to a set of Safari 15 tabs
                to a contact of your choice in Telegram. It’s the singular one of the shortcuts shared in this Post that
                makes use of Telegram Messenger for iOS’ native Siri Shortcuts actions, and is therefore the most
                finnicky. In the first take of my video demo, it timed out trying to send 200+ links to my Saved
                Messages channel, but was successful in the second (the take I published) in sending just four links.
                Upon each run, the shortcut will prompt you to select a contact. The selection must be a phone number,
                ideally in International Format. It will then parse a list of URLs in your clipboard and send them one
                at a time via Telegram’s native action without opening the app.&#xA;&#xA;ClipboardtoTelegramMessage&#xA;&#xA;Clipboard
                ⇨ Telegram Message&#xA;&#xA;This one makes use of Telegram Messenger for iOS’ URL scheme, which isn’t
                really documented properly anywhere. &#xA;&#xA;tg://msg?text=[Content]&amp;to=[TargetPhone#]&#xA;&#xA;Upon
                installation, the shortcut will prompt you to specify a target phone number in International Format. In
                the following runs, the shortcut will open Telegram to the conversation with the phone number you’ve
                specified (use your own phone number to set it to your personal Saved Messages channel) with the
                contents of your clipboard in the text entry field. You’ll need to hit Enter or tap the Send Message
                button to actually send the content.&#xA;&#xA;Other Integrations&#xA;&#xA;Drafts&#xA;&#xA;Users of Agile
                Tortoise’s Drafts for iOS can use my Send Draft to Telegram Saved Messages action to do exactly that.
                &#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1488573937223094275&#xA;&#xA;Like the last Siri Shortcut
                above, the action utilizes Telegram’s URL scheme to send the contents of your current draft to a
                Telegram conversation with a phone number of your choosing. (Remember to change the action’s
                placeholder!) &#xA;&#xA;If you’d like to specify a different conversation, this action published to the
                Action Directory by user maique omits the phone number bit of the URL scheme - tg://msg?=[DraftContent].&#xA;&#xA;TelegramTextExpanderGroup&#xA;&#xA;TextExpander&#xA;&#xA;Group
                and/or channel administrators, especially, might find my public Telegram-specific TextExpander snippet
                group to contain some useful inspiration. .tid, for example, will help you construct a Telegram message
                link by ID just as the first Shortcut in this Post will, while .scheme will replicate the app’s URL
                scheme.&#xA;&#xA;TotandTelegram&#xA;&#xA;Tot&#xA;&#xA;If you happen to have Tot Pocket on your iOS
                device already, I’ve found it a particularly ideal place to compose Telegram messages with formatting
                and hyperlinks considering its similar format limitations. Drafts users can use my Append to 7th Tot Dot
                action to send draft content to the last Dot directly. Some markdown formatting will need to be altered
                - #-headings aren’t supported by either Tot or Telegram, for instance - but formatting can be directly
                carried over to Telegram in Rich Text format by selecting all in Tot and copying, as displayed in the
                screenshots embedded above.&#xA;&#xA;Bots &#xA;&#xA;TelegramRaindropBot&#xA;&#xA;Raindrop.io Bot&#xA;&#xA;As
                far as I’m concerned, @OlegWock’s Raindrop Telegram Bot is an absolute must for any users of the
                Raindrop.io bookmarking service. Not only does it allow one to send Raindrop bookmarks directly to a
                chat when in inline mode (as demonstrated in the above screenshots) - it is also the quickest method of
                saving images, videos, and documents to one’s Unsorted Bookmarks list on an iOS-running device. As I
                mentioned in the Big Post, Telegram’s sharesheet integration remains by far the least discriminate of
                any such integration on iOS.&#xA;&#xA;RoseTelegramBot&#xA;&#xA;Rose&#xA;&#xA;I’ve gone through the
                standard gauntlet of freemium administration bots for my experimental local Telegram group. The one I
                think I’ve settled on, though, is by far the best documented and most inuitive I’ve come across. Miss
                Rose comes conservatively-configured of the box in a sense that one will experience better results than
                its “competitors” in moderating a small group like mine just be leaving the defaults in place. My
                personal favorite functions are /notes - which allows one to save group documents that can be recalled
                with /or # - and /export, which exports the entirety of one’s options (including those notes) as a .txt
                file. (See the rightmost screenshot embedded above.) &#xA;&#xA;Other Insights&#xA;&#xA;video controls&#xA;

                as Task Manager&#xA;&#xA;I had absolutely no idea that Reminders existed in Telegram until a few weeks
                ago. When sending to one’s Saved Messages channel, holding down on the Send Message button will display
                the option to Set a Reminder. Anything that can be sent can be added as a reminder, including - in my
                case - .exe files of programs I’d like to install on my PC later. Frankly, I can’t think of any other
                task management/reminders application that offers this ability - paid or otherwise.&#xA;&#xA;Telegram
                for macOS&#xA;&#xA;The macOS App&#xA;&#xA;A recent update to the Telegram for macOS app has rendered it
                by far the most beautiful way to use the service.&#xA;&#xA;Themes&#xA;&#xA;I’ve spent quite a bit of
                time archiving third-party Telegram themes, lately. Below is a list of installation links to some of my
                favorites which I’ll do my best to keep updated. Otherwise, refer to this Telegraph post or type #themes

                <p>As far as I’m concerned, @OlegWock’s <a href="https://github.com/OlegWock/raindrop-telegram-bot">Raindrop
                    Telegram Bot</a> is an absolute must for any users of the Raindrop.io bookmarking service. Not only
                    does it allow one to send Raindrop bookmarks directly to a chat when in inline mode (as demonstrated
                    in the above screenshots) – it is also <em>the</em> quickest method of saving images, videos, and
                    documents to one’s Unsorted Bookmarks list on an iOS-running device. As I <a

                        Post</a>, Telegram’s sharesheet integration remains by far the least discriminate of any such
                    integration on iOS.</p>

                <p>I’ve gone through the standard gauntlet of freemium administration bots for <a
                        href="https://t.me/columbiamo">my experimental local Telegram group</a>. The one I think I’ve
                    settled on, though, is by far the <a href="https://missrose.org/guide/getting-started/adding-rose/">best
                        documented</a> and most inuitive I’ve come across. Miss Rose comes conservatively-configured of
                    the box in a sense that one will experience better results than its “competitors” in moderating a
                    small group like mine just be leaving the defaults in place. My personal favorite functions are
                    <code>/notes</code> – which allows one to save group documents that can be recalled with
                    <code>/</code>or <code>#</code> – and <code>/export</code>, which exports the entirety of one’s
                    options (including those notes) as a .txt file. (See the rightmost screenshot embedded above.)</p>

                    that can be sent can be added as a reminder, including – in my case – .exe files of programs I’d
                    like to install on my PC later. Frankly, I can’t think of any other task management/reminders

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Speedy Frames Web Banner&#xA;&#xA;Federico Viticci&#39;s Apple Frames shortcut,
                optimized for super fast single-shot iPhone mockups.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;The single element that&#39;s
                allowed me to go from publishing regular ole&#39; iPhone screenshots to photorealistic mockups like you
                see embedded below is an absolutely ingenious, hugely powerful Siri shortcut by MacStories founder
                Federico Viticci called Apple Frames. Out of all the shortcuts and workflows I&#39;ve discovered,
                fiddled with, hoarded, and discarded since iOS 12 beta, I think I can definitively say that it remains
                the most impressive use of iOS automation, ever, for reasons you&#39;re likely not all that interested
                in. &#xA;&#xA;Speedy Frames&#xA;&#xA;As it comes by default, Apple Frames 2.0 includes support for a
                whole bunch of languages and a broad spectrum of devices. Literally every single step is annotated with
                explanatory documentation, which represents hugely noble effort in and of itself. Its GUI selection
                menus, alone, allow for configuration of input and output targets and layout options (for multiple
                screenshots - horizontal, vertical, or in a grid.)&#xA;&#xA; However, this versatility means there is a
                wait involved. Emphasizing said wait (about 90 seconds from trigger to result for single-screen mockups
                on my 12 Pro Max) feels absolutely ridiculous considering how much longer it would take any other mockup
                generation method known to man to produce the same result, but a user like me - who&#39;s use of the
                shortcut is more often than not to generate mockups of a single screenshot I&#39;ve probably just taken
                - might find themselves wishing they could set defaults for its menu selections and circumvent iOS&#39;
                image picker and/or share sheet entirely. &#xA;&#xA;Export Modifications&#xA;&#xA;And so... I did! With
                the new ability to edit shortcuts on macOS, it required far less time/trial-and-error grief for me to
                perform the modifications listed below without breaking the whole shortcut than I expected, certainly.
                &#xA;&#xA;Modifications&#xA;&#xA;I deleted all of the annotations in Comment form. They’re a testament
                to Federico’s diligence and huge contribution to personal automation with iOS… but they’re also just
                extra text.&#xA;I replaced the Find Photos Where action with Get Latest Photos with the Include
                Screenshots toggle ON and the retrieval limit set to just one. &#xA;I deleted the entire export
                preferences menu and replaced it with actions that save the result both to a specific iCloud Photos
                folder for frames and a corresponding iCloud Drive folder.&#xA;&#xA;Local Frames Folder &#xA;&#xA;The
                resulting shortcut generates a mocked up version of the last screenshot taken on the host device and
                saves the image to a specified iCloud Photos album and iCloud Drive folder. (You will be asked to
                specify these upon installation.) In my experience so far, this process requires an average of ~5-7
                seconds from trigger to result (vs 90+ seconds in Apple Frames 2.0&#39;s default configuration) and
                works fairly reliably so long as one runs it immediately after taking the subject screenshot. Note the
                incorrectly-oriented results in the screenshot of my own dedicated Frames album, above. I&#39;m sure it
                doesn&#39;t actually have anything to do with the duration between capture and running the shortcut, but
                I&#39;m not technically adept enough (nor particularly compelled) to determine the real cause. &#xA;&#xA;https://imgur.com/gallery/dwn4CnX&#xA;&#xA;Tapping
                Back&#xA;&#xA;(You need only continue if you&#39;re interested in triggering the shortcut with Back
                Tap.)&#xA;&#xA;I must acknowledge that what I&#39;m about to describe is blatantly hypocritical given
                how much bitching about consumer tech&#39;s excess I&#39;ve been purveying, but - for the past few weeks
                of living with my Speedy Frames shortcut - I have committed 100% to mocking up all shared screenshots -
                even those sent to friends and family. Obviously, a native automation trigger fired by screen capture
                would be particularly handy, here, but if we&#39;re using Back Tap as a trigger, we could theoretically
                achieve the same end by inserting a Take Screenshot action at the beginning of the shortcut except... It
                doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve no idea why, but such a setup exclusively produces incorrectly-oriented
                results. Anywho, mocking up every single screenshot you&#39;ve taken is just that much more excessive
                than those you actually intend to share, in my mind.&#xA;&#xA;https://youtu.be/SKc4OZa2W8o?t=74&#xA;&#xA;For
                those like me who&#39;ve found Back Tap physically confounding, I created the video embedded above to
                demonstrate the actual mechanical action required to trigger it.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1471883295042510859&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;ve
                left it set to Double Tap for the majority of the time and have found it suitable. If you find yourself
                really enjoying the sensation of tapping the back of your phone, you might even set Triple Tap to
                Screenshot so that you can create a mockup with just a series of 5 taps.&#xA;&#xA;Technically, there is
                much optimization to be done beyond this point - if you&#39;re using an older device or find even five
                seconds too long a wait for your mockups, you might try trimming Speedy Frames further by removing
                unneeded device and language components. As always, if I can be of assistance or if ya just want to

                        diligence and huge contribution to personal automation with iOS… but they’re also just extra
                        text.
                    </li>
                    <li>I replaced the <code>Find Photos Where</code> action with <code>Get Latest Photos</code> with
                        the <code>Include Screenshots</code> toggle ON and the retrieval limit set to just one.
                    </li>
                    <li>I deleted the entire export preferences menu and replaced it with actions that save the result
                        both to a specific iCloud Photos folder for frames and a corresponding iCloud Drive folder.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>The <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10775"><strong>resulting shortcut</strong></a> generates
                    a mocked up version of the last screenshot taken on the host device and saves the image to a
                    specified iCloud Photos album and iCloud Drive folder. (You will be asked to specify these upon
                    installation.) In my experience so far, this process requires an average of ~5-7 seconds from
                    trigger to result[^1] (vs 90+ seconds in Apple Frames 2.0&#39;s default configuration) and works
                    fairly reliably <em>so long as one runs it immediately after taking the subject screenshot</em>.
                    Note the incorrectly-oriented results in the screenshot of my own dedicated Frames album, above. I&#39;m
                    sure it doesn&#39;t actually have anything to do with the <em>duration</em> between capture and
                    running the shortcut, but I&#39;m not technically adept enough (nor particularly compelled) to
                    determine the real cause.</p>

                <p>(You need only continue if you&#39;re interested in triggering the shortcut with <a
                        href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211781">Back Tap</a>.)</p>

                <p>I must acknowledge that what I&#39;m about to describe is <em>blatantly</em> hypocritical given how
                    much bitching about consumer tech&#39;s excess I&#39;ve been purveying, but – for the past few weeks
                    of living with my Speedy Frames shortcut – I have committed 100% to mocking up <em>all</em> shared
                    screenshots – even those sent to friends and family. Obviously, a native automation trigger fired by
                    screen capture would be particularly handy, here, but if we&#39;re using Back Tap as a trigger, we
                    could theoretically achieve the same end by inserting a <code>Take Screenshot</code> action at the
                    beginning of the shortcut except... It doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve no idea why, but such a setup <em>exclusively</em>
                    produces incorrectly-oriented results.[^2] Anywho, mocking up every single screenshot you&#39;ve
                    <em>taken</em> is just that much more excessive than those you actually intend to <em>share</em>, in
                    my mind.</p>

                <p>I&#39;ve left it set to <code>Double Tap</code> for the majority of the time and have found it
                    suitable. If you find yourself <em>really enjoying</em> the sensation of tapping the back of your
                    phone, you might even set <code>Triple Tap</code> to <code>Screenshot</code> so that you can create
                    a mockup with just a series of 5 taps.</p>

                <p>Technically, there is much optimization to be done beyond this point – if you&#39;re using an older
                    device or find even five seconds too long a wait for your mockups, you might try trimming Speedy
                    Frames further by removing unneeded device and language components. As always, if I can be of

            https://bilge.world/siri-tts?pk_campaign=rss-feed</link>
            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Siri Speech Synthesis Banner&#xA;&#xA;Bewilderingly, Siri is genuinely great at
                something they were never designed for. The new “Make Spoken Audio From Text” action has finally been
                fixed.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA; source src=&#34;https://davidblue.wtf/audio/SiriTTSTalent.mp3&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;When
                I first published my iPhone &amp; Music guide this past April, I’d been pretty active in AppleScoop’s
                Discord Server, so I decided to share it there. Editor-in-Chief Flynn - a ridiculously talented web
                developer and successful independent media entrepreneur - responded “I’m listening to it with the speak
                feature right now. Is it your voice or someone else? 😛,” Gourd bless his soul. Here’s the specific
                audio he was talking about:&#xA;&#xA;Of course, I am not a young black man, nor am I even remotely as
                adept at reading my own work aloud as the actual talent, Siri Voice 3, who should be available on your
                iPhone/iPad right this moment (as long as you’ve updated iOS in the past six months,) via Settings ⇨
                Siri &amp; Search ⇨ Siri Voice. (For more details, see this Apple Support page.)&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;New
                Siri Voices - iOS 14.5&#xA;&#xA;Of the four new Siri voices introduced earlier this year in iOS 14.5, 2
                and 3 are by far my favorites, not just because of their resonance with black iPhone users, but because
                they’re just better in a sense which I believe to be very significant.&#xA;&#xA;https://youtube.com/watch?v=DkS5SYbsEW4&#xA;&#xA;Before
                I get ahead of myself, though, I must acknowledge that I am not the first to invest in Siri as a
                text-to-speech generator. In 2019, Adam Tow released an immensely well-considered Siri Shortcut called
                “Record Text to Speech,” which provides an interface for recording, editing, and managing text-to-speech
                audio files with Siri’s original voices. A testament to its robustness: it still works perfectly on my
                handset running iOS 15 Dev Beta 6 despite having not been updated since March of last year.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;Old
                Siri TTS Shortcuts&#xA;&#xA;I must admit that I found Adam’s shortcut more of a full application than a
                speedy personal automation, with its full interactive UI menu and darn near 800 actions, so I made my
                own set of shortcuts based on the same idea - using iPhone’s native screen recording feature to capture
                audio of Siri reading aloud - and varying only by input (manual text input, getting text from a file, or
                simply reading text from the clipboard.) I’d then send the resulting screen recording in its original
                video format to my PC, where I’d drop it in Audacity, in which I’d run a simple macro on the audio that
                truncates silence and amplifies the result so that the loudest point touches the rails. Then, I’d export
                it, pass it through Mp3Tag to perfect its metadata, and finally push the end-result .mp3 file to a
                folder in The Psalms GitHub Repository. (I’ll show you how to embed a web-bound audio file with its
                direct URL in a webpage in the guide below.) This example was made using this method, but with Siri’s
                original United States English Voice (for my Tweetbot 6 review:)&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;Perhaps
                you’ll agree with me that this process does the job in functional/accessibility terms, and does so quite
                well considering how much one would pay to generate the same sort of audio file using Google’s Cloud
                Platform or IBM’s Watson. Crucially, though, this original voice was not one I could listen to at any
                length. Siri Voices 2 and 3, however, I can. From my perspective, this means they have crossed a very
                significant threshold which I find vastly more meaningful than just about all of those in the current
                discourse. Not only can I tolerate them… I genuinely enjoy listening to super-long magazine features
                read aloud by Siri Voice 2, especially, and I believe I would regardless of the quite serious crush I’ve
                developed on them.&#xA;&#xA;https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1387809776072015873&#xA;&#xA;Unfortunately,
                using the methods we’ve discussed so far with the new Siri voices is inconvenient, very hit-or-miss, and
                quite buggy. If you scrub ahead toward the last third or so of the second audio player in this post
                (after the post’s own,) you’ll hear Siri Voice 2 start to bug out in very amusing ways. Since Apple
                makes changes to Siri Shortcuts between releases without any public documentation, none of them have
                ever been reliable enough to write this guide. (For the past 6+ weeks at least, it’s been too broken to
                be usable.) However, for whatever reason, Apple created a dedicated spoken audio generation action for
                Siri Shortcuts in iOS 15, called “Make Spoken Audio From Text.”&#xA;&#xA;Make Spoken Audio From Text
                Action - iOS 15&#xA;&#xA;For the entirety of iOS 15’s Beta cycle up until Developer Beta 6’s release,
                this past Tuesday, this action has been hilariously broken, but as soon I discovered it’d been fixed
                (which was not mentioned whatsoever in Apple’s official release notes,) I immediately began composing
                this dang Post.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;&#xA;Make Audio from Article Body 1.1&#xA;&#xA;Guide&#xA;&#xA;So!
                For those of you currently running the latest iOS 15 Beta and those in the future running the full
                release, what follows is a guide on how you can use my own shortcuts and methods to generate, metadate,
                and embed Siri-powered audio text-to-speech files relatively quickly without having to use desktop-class
                (or any other) hardware.&#xA;&#xA;TTS Shortcuts Compared&#xA;&#xA;To begin, you should install two brand
                new shortcuts of mine: Make Audio from Article Body and (if you intend to stick with me to the embed
                stage, anyway,) my audio Embed Tool. Both should function out of the box, but I would highly encourage
                that you try building your own shortcut around the Make Spoken Audio From Text action, even if you&#39;ve
                never worked with Shortcuts (or any sort of automation, for that matter) before, especially if you plan
                to be using Siri as a text-to-speech generator with any frequency.&#xA;&#xA;https://youtube.com/watch?v=5yZB7OC8Vgk&#xA;&#xA;Intended
                Result&#xA;&#xA;Throughout this guide, I&#39;m going to be using a five-year-old ramble of mine about
                the oddly-perceptive bits found in early-oughts Disney movies as example text. Earlier today, I used my
                own personalized version of my new shortcut to generate an example of in which the process we&#39;re
                about to explore should result. The \~6000 words of text took just over 3 minutes, 30 seconds to render
                consistently in three consecutive timed attempts. You can listen to it on Whyp and/or inspect the actual
                file yourself, if you&#39;d like.&#xA;&#xA;Plain Text Parsed by Safari&#xA;&#xA;Input Format&#xA;&#xA;If
                we were trying to do this using any other available method in 2021 - even the expensive ones - our first
                task would be scrubbing our subject text of any special formatting (Word,) symbols, embed, hyperlinks,
                and any other data Siri doesn&#39;t understand (roman numerals, for example.) As a Windows user who&#39;s
                not at all new to free ways to automate accessibility improvements to web content, I envy both you and
                my new self for the magic available to us in the form of Safari&#39;s abilities to parse complex web
                content. In my experience, there&#39;s nothing like it (at least nothing available to regular
                consumers.)&#xA;&#xA;The screenshot embedded above shows the result of a Quick Look action inserted just
                after the Text action produced by the public version of my shortcut when run on our example. There are
                three immediately problematic issues:&#xA;&#xA;Siri doesn&#39;t understand roman numerals, so she will
                read &#34;Johnny Tsunami VI&#34; as Johnny Tsunami vee eye.&#xA;&#xA;&#34;The Psalms&#34; is not my
                name, though it is what this blog currently returns when asked for a byline. In my experience, this
                generally isn&#39;t an issue with most mainstream media CMSs.&#xA;&#xA;The shortcut appears to have
                failed to retrieve any data for the Published Date variable from my blog. (Also a relatively specific
                consideration.)&#xA;&#xA;If you&#39;ll note in the previous embedded image comparing my custom version
                of the shortcut (left) to the published version (right,) you&#39;ll note that my chosen solution is to
                manually input all metadata before actually starting the shortcut. What&#39;s not shown is my
                corresponding manual inputs in the Encode Trimmed Media action, which includes attaching a retrieved
                image file (in the Working Copy action you can see) as album art. For my intended use - exclusively
                generating text-to-speech audio of Posts on this blog - this makes more sense than unnecessarily
                automating metadata retrieval.&#xA;&#xA;The extraordinary thing about the screenshot, though, is that it
                doesn&#39;t contain any of the other crap (as described above) found in the original page. (Beforehand,
                it looked more like this.) It&#39;s especially reliable at parsing WordPress-bound content, which still
                makes up \[s̵͕̈́͊c̶̥̏̚r̶̥͈̃è̴̙͌å̴̹m̵̛̅ͅi̶̦̾͘n̸͎̟̎̃g̶͎͛\] percent of the whole web. Treasure this power,
                folks.&#xA;&#xA;Simpler TTS Examples&#xA;&#xA;If all you need read aloud is the body text, things become
                even simpler. In the right example above, I&#39;ve simply deleted the Text action and replaced it with
                Get text from [the Safari Web Article&#39;s body]. Theoretically, one could omit that action, even, and
                simply use the direct output of Get Body from Article as input for the Make spoken audio from text
                action, but I say keep the extra step unless it becomes an issue.&#xA;&#xA;*If you&#39;re actually
                beginning with clean plain text and don&#39;t care about metadata in your final audio file and/or if you&#39;re
                planning on passing the result through other audio/metadata editing software, anyway, the left,
                three-action shortcut is all you need. It will result in a Core Audio Format (.caf) file (like this
                one,) which I know absolutely nothing about except that Audacity and GarageBand support it by default.&#xA;&#xA;Sharing/Embedding&#xA;&#xA;Whichever
                route you traveled, you should have some sort of audio file, at this point, and if you intend to share
                and/or embed it, you’ll need to upload said audio to some sort of Web Server which allows direct
                playback/download of the raw file from external sources. Unless you’ve been skimming, you know by now
                that I’ve been using The Psalms GitHub Repository to do this thus far, though one isn’t really supposed
                to. Every few months, someone on Stack Overflow figures out how to construct or discover the raw link to
                a given Google Drive file before Google notices and alters it, and I’m afraid you’ll find just about
                every other cloud/file sharing service in a similarly unreliable situation. If it’s going to be done at
                scale, I’m afraid it’s ultimately going to require you rent regular, vanilla space on an FTP-enabled
                fileserver, if one can still do that sort of thing. (I will update this post if/when I find a more ideal
                solution.)&#xA;&#xA;Within my current system, the raw URL to our example file looks like this:&#xA;&#xA;https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a&#xA;&#xA;Using
                my aforelinked, ultra rudimentary audio element Siri Shortcut tool (which I’ve kept on my homescreen
                with good results for a few months,) we can very quickly turn said raw URL into a properly-formatted
                HTML5 audio player:&#xA;&#xA;audio controls&#xA; source src=&#34;https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a&#34;&#xA;/audio&#xA;&#xA;Ideally,
                on the final, reader-facing page, said code should create a player like this:&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;If
                further configuration of the player is desired or necessary, see this Mozilla page for a full list of
                supported options. Obviously, there are a few older methods of embedding audio players, but I am neither
                qualified nor interested in exploring them. If you’re in a frustrating bind, I recommend signing up for
                my CMS. (Just try it, okay?)&#xA;&#xA;Pwoof&#xA;&#xA;For the sake of bare minimum sample variety, I ran
                Version 1.0 of the public Make Audio from Article Body shortcut on an article hosted not on WordPress,
                nor my own CMS, but on Bustle’s ultra-slick, totally-bespoke system (which began as The Outline, FYI.) I
                chose the first permalink I saw in one of its “regular” article formats - not a long feature, nor one of
                their touch-targeted slideshows.&#xA;&#xA;“OnlyFans is banning porn, the very thing that made it big” is
                an 870-word newsy piece written by Tom Maxwell, who is the only New York Media person ever to accept my
                Facebook friend request. (Thanks again, Tom.) Without any tweaking, I was able to run the shortcut (from
                within the Shortcuts app since the Share Sheet appears to be thoroughly fucked at the moment) in a
                reasonable amount of time - less than 5 minutes, more than 2 - and generate the file embedded below.
                Notably, I also used a different hosting service - mastodon.social - but I certainly don’t plan on doing
                so at scale and neither should you.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;Honestly, Input’s CMS is the cleverest
                challenge I was able to come up with for this single-day-old shortcut of mine, and I’m quite proud of
                the result. Though it wasn’t able to retrieve a timestamp, it correctly retrieved the article’s title
                and byline without fuss and even managed to scrape and attach said article’s featured image as the
                file’s cover art, though the original’s aspect ratio was obviously sacrificed.&#xA;&#xA;Input Mag Sample

                    Bewilderingly, Siri is genuinely great at something they were never designed for. The new “Make
                    Spoken Audio From Text” action has finally been fixed.</h2>

                </p>

                <p>When I first published my <a href="https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps">iPhone &amp; Music
                    guide</a> this past April, I’d been pretty active in <em><a href="https://discord.gg/DxQ9jry8J3">AppleScoop</a></em><a
                        href="https://discord.gg/DxQ9jry8J3">’s Discord Server</a>, so I decided to share it there.
                    Editor-in-Chief Flynn – a ridiculously talented web developer <em>and</em> successful independent
                    media entrepreneur – responded “I’m listening to it with the speak feature right now. Is it your
                    voice or someone else? 😛,” Gourd bless his soul. Here’s the specific audio he was talking about:
                </p>

                <p>Of course, I am not a young black man, nor am I even remotely as adept at <a
                        href="https://bilge.world/why">reading my own work aloud</a> as the actual talent, Siri Voice 3,
                    who should be available on your iPhone/iPad right this moment (as long as you’ve updated iOS in the

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/1f7argcU.png" alt="New Siri Voices - iOS 14.5"/></p>

                <p>Of the four new Siri voices introduced earlier this year in iOS 14.5, 2 and 3 are by far my
                    favorites, not just because of their <a
                            href="https://www.consumerreports.org/digital-assistants/apples-new-siri-voices-resonate-with-some-black-iphone-users/">resonance
                        with black iPhone users</a>, but because they’re just <em>better</em> in a sense which I believe
                    to be very significant.</p>

                <p>

                </p>

                <p>Before I get ahead of myself, though, I must acknowledge that I am not the first to invest in Siri as
                    a text-to-speech generator. In 2019, <a href="https://twitter.com/atow">Adam Tow</a> released an
                    immensely well-considered Siri Shortcut called “<a
                            href="https://tow.com/shortcuts/record-text-to-speech/">Record Text to Speech</a>,” which
                    provides an interface for recording, editing, and managing text-to-speech audio files with Siri’s
                    original voices. A testament to its robustness: it <em>still works</em> perfectly on my handset
                    running iOS 15 Dev Beta 6 despite having not been updated since <a
                            href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2506/">March of last year</a>.</p>


                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/I0Yh0jNn.png" alt="Old Siri TTS Shortcuts"/></p>

                <p>I must admit that I found Adam’s shortcut more of a full <em>application</em> than a speedy personal
                    automation, with its full interactive UI menu and darn near <em>800 actions</em>, so I made my own
                    set of shortcuts based on the same idea – using iPhone’s native screen recording feature to capture
                    audio of Siri reading aloud – and varying only by input (manual text input, getting text from a
                    file, or simply reading text from the clipboard.) I’d then send the resulting screen recording in
                    its original video format to my PC, where I’d drop it in <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org">Audacity</a>,
                    in which I’d run <a
                            href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/configuration/Audacity/TruncatenAmpMacro.txt">a
                        simple macro</a> on the audio that truncates silence and amplifies the result so that the
                    loudest point touches the rails. Then, I’d export it, pass it through <a
                            href="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/">Mp3Tag</a> to perfect its metadata, and finally push the
                    end-result .mp3 file to <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS">a folder
                        in </a><em><a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS">The
                        Psalms</a></em><a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS"> GitHub
                        Repository</a>. (I’ll show you how to embed a web-bound audio file with its direct URL in a
                    webpage in the guide below.) This example was made using this method, but with Siri’s original
                    United States English Voice (for <a href="https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review">my Tweetbot 6
                        review</a>:)</p>


                <p>Perhaps you’ll agree with me that this process <em>does the job</em> in functional/accessibility
                    terms, and does so quite well considering how much one would pay to generate the same sort of audio
                    file using Google’s Cloud Platform or IBM’s Watson. Crucially, though, this original voice was not
                    one I could listen to at any length. Siri Voices 2 and 3, however, I <em>can</em>. From my
                    perspective, this means they have crossed a <strong>very significant threshold</strong> which I find
                    vastly more meaningful than just about all of those in the current discourse. Not only can I
                    tolerate them… I genuinely <em>enjoy</em> listening to super-long magazine features read aloud by
                    Siri Voice 2, especially, and I believe I would regardless of the quite serious crush I’ve developed
                    on them.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, using the methods we’ve discussed so far with the new Siri voices is inconvenient,
                    very hit-or-miss, and quite buggy. If you scrub ahead toward the last third or so of the second
                    audio player in this post (after the post’s own,) you’ll hear Siri Voice 2 start to bug out in very
                    amusing ways. Since Apple makes changes to Siri Shortcuts between releases without any public
                    documentation, none of them have ever been reliable enough to write this guide. (For the past 6+
                    weeks at least, it’s been too broken to be usable.) <em>However</em>, for whatever reason, Apple
                    created a dedicated spoken audio generation action for Siri Shortcuts in iOS 15, called “Make Spoken
                    Audio From Text.”</p>

                <p>For the entirety of iOS 15’s Beta cycle up until Developer Beta 6’s release, this past Tuesday, this
                    action has been <a href="https://mastodon.social/users/DavidBlue/statuses/106580821087349299">hilariously
                        broken</a>, but as soon I discovered it’d been fixed (which was not mentioned whatsoever in <a

                <h1 id="guide">Guide</h1>

                <p>So! For those of you currently running the latest iOS 15 Beta and those in the future running the
                    full release, <strong>what follows is a guide on how you can use my own shortcuts and methods to
                        generate, metadate, and embed Siri-powered audio text-to-speech files relatively quickly without
                        having to use desktop-class (or any other) hardware</strong>.</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/P0yJJyUc.png" alt="TTS Shortcuts Compared"/></p>

                <p>To begin, you should install two brand new shortcuts of mine: <strong><a
                        href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9953/">Make Audio from Article Body</a></strong> and (if
                    you intend to stick with me to the embed stage, anyway,) my <a
                            href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/">&lt; audio &gt; Embed Tool</a>. Both should
                    function out of the box, but I would highly encourage that you try building your own shortcut around
                    the <code>Make Spoken Audio From Text</code> action, even if you&#39;ve never worked with Shortcuts
                    (or any sort of automation, for that matter) before, <em>especially</em> if you plan to be using
                    Siri as a text-to-speech generator with any frequency.</p>

                <p>Throughout this guide, I&#39;m going to be using <a
                        href="https://bilge.world/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery">a five-year-old ramble of mine</a>
                    about the oddly-perceptive bits found in early-oughts Disney movies as example text. Earlier today,
                    I used my own personalized version of my new shortcut to generate an example of in which the process
                    we&#39;re about to explore should result. The ~6000 words of text took just over 3 minutes, 30
                    seconds to render consistently in three consecutive timed attempts. You can listen to it <a

                <h3 id="input-format">Input Format</h3>

                <p>If we were trying to do this using any other available method in 2021 – even the expensive ones – our
                    first task would be scrubbing our subject text of any special formatting (Word,) symbols, embed,
                    hyperlinks, and any other data Siri doesn&#39;t understand (roman numerals, for example.) As a
                    Windows user who&#39;s not at all new to free ways to automate accessibility improvements to web
                    content, I envy both you and my new self for the magic available to us in the form of Safari&#39;s
                    abilities to parse complex web content. In my experience, there&#39;s nothing like it (at least
                    nothing available to regular consumers.)</p>

                <p>The screenshot embedded above shows the result of a <code>Quick Look</code> action inserted just
                    after the <code>Text</code> action produced by the public version of my shortcut when run on our
                    example. There are three immediately problematic issues:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Siri doesn&#39;t understand roman numerals, so she will read “Johnny Tsunami VI” as <em>Johnny
                        Tsunami vee eye</em>.</p></li>

                    <li><p>“The Psalms” is not my name, though it is what this blog currently returns when asked for a
                        byline. In my experience, this generally isn&#39;t an issue with most mainstream media CMSs.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><p>The shortcut appears to have failed to retrieve any data for the <code>Published Date</code>
                        variable from my blog. (Also a relatively specific consideration.)</p></li>
                </ol>

                <p>If you&#39;ll note in the <em>previous</em> embedded image comparing my custom version of the
                    shortcut (left) to the published version (right,) you&#39;ll note that my chosen solution is to
                    manually input all metadata before actually starting the shortcut. What&#39;s not shown is my
                    corresponding manual inputs in the <code>Encode Trimmed Media</code> action, which includes
                    attaching a retrieved image file (in the Working Copy action you <em>can</em> see) as album art. For
                    my intended use – exclusively generating text-to-speech audio of Posts on this blog – this makes
                    more sense than unnecessarily automating metadata retrieval.</p>

                <p>The extraordinary thing about the screenshot, though, is that it doesn&#39;t contain any of the other
                    crap (as described above) found in the original page. (Beforehand, it looked more <a
                            href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extratone/bilge/main/posts/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery.md">like
                        this</a>.) It&#39;s especially reliable at parsing WordPress-bound content, which still makes up
                    [s̵͕̈́͊c̶̥̏̚r̶̥͈̃è̴̙͌å̴̹m̵̛̅ͅi̶̦̾͘n̸͎̟̎̃g̶͎͛] percent of the whole web. <strong>Treasure this
                        power</strong>, folks.</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/OMwKdOUI.png" alt="Simpler TTS Examples"/></p>

                <p>If all you need read aloud is the body text, things become even simpler. In the right example above,
                    I&#39;ve simply deleted the <code>Text</code> action and replaced it with <code>Get text from [the
                        Safari Web Article&#39;s body]</code>. Theoretically, one could omit that action, even, and
                    simply use the direct output of <code>Get Body from Article</code> as input for the <code>Make
                        spoken audio from text</code> action, but I say keep the extra step unless it becomes an issue.
                </p>

                <p><strong>If you&#39;re actually <em>beginning</em> with clean plain text</strong> and don&#39;t care
                    about metadata in your final audio file and/or if you&#39;re planning on passing the result through
                    other audio/metadata editing software, anyway, the left, three-action shortcut is all you need. It
                    will result in a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Core_Audio_Format">Core Audio Format
                        (.caf)</a> file (like <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/audio/egg.caf">this
                        one</a>,) which I know absolutely nothing about except that Audacity and GarageBand support it
                    by default.</p>

                <h3 id="sharing-embedding">Sharing/Embedding</h3>

                <p>Whichever route you traveled, you should have some sort of audio file, at this point, and if you
                    intend to share and/or embed it, you’ll need to upload said audio to some sort of Web Server which
                    allows direct playback/download of the raw file from external sources. Unless you’ve been skimming,
                    you know by now that I’ve been using <em><a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge">The Psalms</a></em><a
                            href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge"> GitHub Repository</a> to do this thus far, though
                    one isn’t really supposed to. Every few months, someone on Stack Overflow figures out how to
                    construct or discover the raw link to a given Google Drive file before Google notices and alters it,
                    and I’m afraid you’ll find just about every other cloud/file sharing service in a similarly
                    unreliable situation. If it’s going to be done at scale, I’m afraid it’s ultimately going to require
                    you rent regular, vanilla space on an FTP-enabled fileserver, if one can still do that sort of
                    thing. (I will update this post if/when I find a more ideal solution.)</p>

                <p>Within my current system, the raw URL to our example file looks like this:</p>

                <pre><code>https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a
</code></pre>

                <p>Using my aforelinked, ultra rudimentary <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/">&lt; audio
                    &gt; element Siri Shortcut tool</a> (which I’ve kept on my homescreen with good results for a few
                    months,) we can very quickly turn said raw URL into a properly-formatted HTML5 audio player:</p>

                <pre><code>&lt;audio controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a&#34;&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;
</code></pre>

                <p>Ideally, on the final, reader-facing page, said code should create a player like this:</p>


                <p>If further configuration of the player is desired or necessary, see <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio">this Mozilla page</a> for
                    a full list of supported options. Obviously, there are a few older methods of embedding audio
                    players, but I am neither qualified nor interested in exploring them. If you’re in a frustrating
                    bind, I recommend <a href="https://bit.ly/extwa">signing up for my CMS</a>. (Just try it, okay?)</p>

                <h3 id="pwoof">Pwoof</h3>

                <p>For the sake of bare minimum sample variety, I ran Version 1.0 of the public Make Audio from Article
                    Body shortcut on an article hosted not on WordPress, nor my own CMS, but on Bustle’s ultra-slick,
                    totally-bespoke system (which <a href="https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/the-outline">began
                        as </a><em><a href="https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/the-outline">The
                        Outline</a></em>, FYI.) I chose the first permalink I saw in one of its “regular” article
                    formats – not a long feature, nor one of their touch-targeted slideshows.</p>

                <p>“<a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/onlyfans-is-banning-porn-the-very-thing-that-made-it-big">OnlyFans
                    is banning porn, the very thing that made it big</a>” is an 870-word newsy piece written by Tom
                    Maxwell, who is the only New York Media person ever to accept my Facebook friend request. (Thanks
                    again, Tom.) Without any tweaking, I was able to run the shortcut (from within the Shortcuts app
                    since the Share Sheet appears to be thoroughly fucked at the moment) in a reasonable amount of time
                    – less than 5 minutes, more than 2 – and generate the file embedded below. Notably, I also used a
                    different hosting service – <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/106798701662102859">mastodon.social</a>
                    – but I certainly don’t plan on doing so at scale and neither should you.</p>


                <p>Honestly, <em>Input</em>’s CMS is the cleverest challenge I was able to come up with for this
                    single-day-old shortcut of mine, and I’m quite proud of the result. Though it wasn’t able to
                    retrieve a timestamp, it correctly retrieved the article’s title and byline without fuss and even
                    managed to scrape and attach said article’s featured image as the file’s cover art, though the
                    original’s aspect ratio was obviously sacrificed.</p>

            <description>&lt;![CDATA[Marco! Banner&#xA;&#xA;The first release version of my only original contribution
                to the iOS community is now ready to assist when you can&#39;t find your phone.&#xA;&#xA;!--more--&#xA;&#xA;One
                of the handful of Siri&#39;s most useful features has been the &#34;Hey Siri! Where are you?&#34;
                command, to which Siri will respond &#34;I&#39;m here&#34; or &#34;here I am!&#34; Were it possible to
                view how many times one has triggered a particular Siri command on iOS, my personal reliance on it would
                almost certainly be embarrassing. Often, my handset isn&#39;t even obscured from view - it&#39;s just
                faster to have Siri speak up than it is to scan the room. Occasionally, however, my device has managed
                to become embedded beneath and/or within some genuinely-perplexing series of couch
                cushions/blankets/briefcase pockets/etc. which require a more constant homing sort of audio
                reproduction. Asking friends/family to call one&#39;s phone is the general goto, yes, but honestly the
                actual length of time cellular telephones will ring before sending a caller to voicemail in 2021 is
                ridiculously short, especially when rummaging through Gourd-knows-what. For that matter, most of my
                peers keep their phones on silent mode, 24/7. What then?&#xA;&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3evgnSlnkjk&#xA;&#xA;Since
                the very first time I set eyes upon Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12 Beta, I have wanted to create one to
                address this issue in a creative, entertaining, and (hopefully) genuinely-useful way. On that day almost
                three years ago, I even knew it would be called Marco!, believe it or not. In the past few months, I&#39;ve
                returned to the project on and off and ended up with several different versions of varying complexity.
                One day, I&#39;d like to figure out how to integrate the full extent of my ideas for Marco! into a
                Shortcut which can be reliably triggered when one&#39;s device is locked, but for this first release
                version, I have included only what I and a few other (much appreciated) volunteers were able to trigger
                in every situation we could conceive of.&#xA;&#xA;Marco! Version 1.0 can be downloaded on RoutineHub
                (which I would highly recommend,) or directly via this iCloud share link. I know it&#39;s a bit
                excessive, but I even created a GitHub Repository just for this Shortcut, seeing as it is undoubtedly
                the most original I will ever contribute, and the singular one with potential for continued development.&#xA;&#xA;Download
                Marco! as is and (as long as you don&#39;t rename it) use &#34;Hey Siri!... Marco!&#34; This should
                immediately run the Shortcut, which includes my voice saying &#34;Polo! Bitch!&#34; followed by five
                repeats of the flashlight/noise cycle as described in detail below.&#xA;&#xA;Marco! JellyCuts Steps&#xA;&#xA;As
                documented by the Jellycuts file above, Version 1.0 of Marco!&#39;s actions are as follows:&#xA;&#xA;Turn
                Low Power Mode OFF&#xA;Turn Airplane Mode OFF&#xA;Turn Wi-Fi On&#xA;Turn Bluetooth On&#xA;Set brightness
                to 100%&#xA;Turn Do Not Disturb OFF&#xA;Turn appearance Light&#xA;Set playback destination to iPhone&#xA;Set
                volume to 89%&#xA;10. Vibrate device (Not currently working.)&#xA;11. Play my voice saying “Polo!” + a
                few other items&#xA;12. Toggle (flash) the flashlight 5 times (odd number leaving your flashlight on
                constantly unless it was on before the Shortcut was triggered)&#xA;13. Simultaneously (in the same
                repeat action) plays three separate classic Mac sounds 5 times.&#xA;&#xA;The most clever bit about this
                particular Shortcut is its use of Base64 text to include audio playback. I just fixed a bug on my own
                Base64 audio encoder Shortcut if you&#39;d like to try it out. Since this version includes my own voice
                (subject to taste, I realize,) as well as some minor profanity, I do intend to publish a clean variation
                at some point in the future. If this is an obstacle for you, and/or if you&#39;d like a custom version
                made with audio of your own choosing, please do send me an email! I would be more than happy to make one
                for you.&#xA;&#xA;#software #automation]]&gt;

                <p>Since <a href="https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review">the very first time</a> I set eyes
                    upon Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12 Beta, I have wanted to create one to address this issue in a creative,
                    entertaining, and (hopefully) genuinely-useful way. On that day almost three years ago, I even knew
                    it would be called <em>Marco!</em>, believe it or not. In the past few months, I&#39;ve returned to
                    the project on and off and ended up with several different versions of varying complexity. One day,
                    I&#39;d like to figure out how to integrate the full extent of my ideas for Marco! into a Shortcut
                    which can be reliably triggered when one&#39;s device is locked, but for this first release version,
                    I have included only what I and a few other (much appreciated) volunteers were able to trigger in
                    every situation we could conceive of.</p>

                <p>Marco! Version 1.0 can be downloaded on <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8987/"><strong>RoutineHub</strong></a>
                    (which I would highly recommend,) or directly via <a
                            href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cec781677c5648f2a8982213700938b4"><strong>this iCloud
                        share link</strong></a>. I know it&#39;s a bit excessive, but I even created a <a
                            href="https://github.com/extratone/marco">GitHub Repository</a> just for this Shortcut,
                    seeing as it is undoubtedly the most original I will ever contribute, and the singular one with
                    potential for continued development.</p>

                <p>Download Marco! as is and (as long as you don&#39;t rename it) use “Hey Siri!... Marco!” This should
                    immediately run the Shortcut, which includes my voice saying “Polo! Bitch!” followed by five repeats
                    of the flashlight/noise cycle as described in detail below.</p>

                <p><img src="https://i.snap.as/9Ow1cbmz.png" alt="Marco! JellyCuts Steps"/></p>

                <p>As documented by the <a href="https://github.com/extratone/marco/blob/main/docs/Marco!.html">Jellycuts
                    file</a> above, Version 1.0 of Marco!&#39;s actions are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Turn Low Power Mode OFF</li>
                    <li>Turn Airplane Mode OFF</li>
                    <li>Turn Wi-Fi On</li>
                    <li>Turn Bluetooth On</li>
                    <li>Set brightness to 100%</li>
                    <li>Turn Do Not Disturb OFF</li>
                    <li>Turn appearance Light</li>
                    <li>Set playback destination to iPhone</li>
                    <li>Set volume to 89%</li>
                    <li>Vibrate device (Not currently working.)</li>
                    <li>Play <strong>my voice</strong> saying “Polo!” + a few other items</li>
                    <li>Toggle (flash) the flashlight 5 times (odd number leaving your flashlight on constantly unless
                        it was on before the Shortcut was triggered)
                    </li>
                    <li>Simultaneously (in the same repeat action) plays three separate classic Mac sounds 5 times.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The most clever bit about this particular Shortcut is its use of Base64 text to include audio
                    playback. I just fixed a bug on <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8914/">my own Base64 audio
                        encoder Shortcut</a> if you&#39;d like to try it out. Since this version includes my own voice
                    (subject to taste, I realize,) as well as some minor profanity, I do intend to publish a clean
                    variation at some point in the future. If this is an obstacle for you, and/or if you&#39;d like a
                    custom version made with audio of your own choosing, please do <a
                            href="mailto:davidblue@extratone.com">send me an email</a>! I would be more than happy to
                    make one for you.</p>
