Many JSBox examples are located in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/cyanzhong/xTeko, this repo contains all official demos, it is a little bit difficult to install a particular one into your device.

This script provides an easy way for installing demos, it can download a specific sub-folder of a GitHub repo, downloaded files can be installed as a JSBox script, also can be saved to the Files app.

For example, this is a JSBox demo: https://github.com/cyanzhong/xTeko/tree/master/extension-demos/stack-view

You can copy it before opening this script, or scan a QR code that can be generated by your Chrome extension. Besides, opening from mobile Safari is also supported.

If the repo itself is a JSBox script, you can also use this script to download the `master` branch, it's going to download the `/archive/master.zip` file directly.

Note that, some sub-folders have tons of files, this script may not be able to handle it due to the GitHub API restrictions, please only use it for small demos.
